"The removable top screws over the bottom. The material is cheap. The screw is poorly machined. The metal-on-metal screeching sound is like nails on a chalkboard. Happens twice per use - once when you open it to put tea in and then second time when you clean it. The sound makes my hair on my beck stand and even the thought of that sound makes me cringe. The negative-sense reinforcement from that sound was so bad that I always hesitated to make tea until I bought a different type of tea strainer.

There are some other flaws too:
1. Even the smallest one is too big. Most of the container is empty when I used it.
2. The hook is a nice design idea in theory but in practice the hook often falls of the edge of the cup which means you now have to use a fork to pull out the tea-drowned strainer.
3. The bottom container's top edge is a bit sharp and you can hurt yourself if you're not careful when cleaning
4. The material is cheap.

The seal is not great, so if it has air in it and the slightest pressure hits it, it will pop open.

Time, the bandage popped right off and I had to take it off, as I could not get it to stick again. I had 2 different wounds I tried them on, one is on my finger, so I wrapped the bandage around my finger and held it there for a few minutes, about ten minutes later, the edge of the bandage popped up and would not stick.

"Had some problems with this design. Perhaps more an issue with the design of the coffee maker itself? Meaning, if the coffee machines coffee cup holder size is too small, you will then have an reusable coffee cut as this product, also made too small. I like a strong cup of coffee, that does NOT mean, ""use less water"" to concentrate the amount of coffee by the amount of water being used; indicative of espresso. No. That means I want to use MORE coffee per cup. Fundamental built-in flaw into the design of the model B60 Im using. Of course, the coffee maker coffee cup size dictates the size of the reusable cup as we see here. That said, the design of this cup FURTHER added to my frustration in that the design where the water is injected at the top of the cup, the lid, routes the water jet mostly to the sides, and not even enough at that. It neglects the top of the coffee cup where I can find almost dry coffee grinds. At first I tried just having to LIMIT EVEN MORE my already too limited amount of coffee so that the top of the total amount of coffee in the cup was lower...not happy. What I ended up trying was literally cut every other small piece of plastic that makes up the inbound jet on the lid; i cut them at the top and folded that little piece of plastic out...which I hoped would help jet more water upwards towards the top of the coffee line. That worked better. I would suggest this mod... Other than the fundamental cup size by Keurig, this product worked as desired, with the modification I made.",Ergonomics

"Wow, these really suck. I have seen these sheets and wanted to try them. I like to try & be environmentally conscious. Since I am moving across the country, I figured this would be a great time to try some. My only real problem with them is that you have to use 4 sheets to wash a load. I normally use Tide, just fill up the tray on my machine. About a cap full per load and everything is fine. My kids get very dirty. I think their favorite thing to do is dig in dirt. I tried using a sheet, didn't even look like my clothes had been washed. I kept upping it. It takes 4 sheets to do a load I normally used 1 cap full on. They smell fine, I bought 4 boxes, 2 different scents. They don't really leave a smell on the clothes. They are really convenient. I just rip one up & throw it in the laundry basket with the dirty clothes everytime I've gotten about a sheet full ( about a lightly filled small laundry basket worth) then just dump the whole thing in the washer.
