"I found this floss an excellent replacement for the plastic wax floss I used to buy. The crest floss I have used for years used to snap occasionally, but this floss, despite being thinner and feeling finer, hasn't broken once yet. I've only used it for a couple months though, so months vs years is hardly a good comparison. The flavor is light, more like a hint of mint. I don't have any issues sliding between my teeth. Actually being thinner, it's a litter easier to use. Overall I feel it works just as well as the plastic floss. Only a minor concern is the spot where the floss comes out of the top of the bottle is right next to the metal sliver so you have this super tiny thread just sticking out. It's not terrible to keep it from falling back in the bottle, but it does happen.

"I found this floss an excellent replacement for the plastic wax floss I used to buy. The crest floss I have used for years used to snap occasionally, but this floss, despite being thinner and feeling finer, hasn't broken once yet. I've only used it for a couple months though, so months vs years is hardly a good comparison. The flavor is light, more like a hint of mint. I don't have any issues sliding between my teeth. Actually being thinner, it's a litter easier to use. Overall I feel it works just as well as the plastic floss.

Only a minor concern is the spot where the floss comes out of the top of the bottle is right next to the metal sliver so you have this super tiny thread just sticking out. It's not terrible to keep it from falling back in the bottle, but it does happen.

"A good idea, but, in the end not worth it.

1st - the discs are a good size, but, have no absorbency. I use micelar water for cleansing and it just beads and runs over the edge before it has a chance to sink in to the pad. This actually makes me doubt the “organic” claim somewhat. I have no proof one way or the other. I only have my experience with other organic cotton products to guide me here.

2nd - Washing up. The mesh bag is much too small to allow the discs to get properly clean in the washing machine, so I used a larger mesh bag I have for other things. Make up stains didn’t come out making me feel as if I am not using a clean product. Also, the wash cycle leaves the pads shrunk and crumpled up like a fortune cookie. They will never have the same aesthetically pleasing form they arrived in, unless you wish to iron them out after you wash them. That may be a lot of trouble for something you use to clean your face with, but your decision.

3rd - On arrival the presentation is pretty enough, but, the cardboard storage box is not something that will hold up in the steamy bathroom environment. In a paper vs. humidity battle, humidity will always win. I don’t care how good your bathroom fan is, that room is going to get humid and the storage box is going to get ruined quickly.",Performance

2) The floss is grippier than most synthetic floss, but my dentist told me this is ideal and helps remove more tartar and bacteria than smooth floss.
3) The floss doesn’t break any more than synthetic floss. I have one tooth that is notorious for busting any floss I use. With flossing every day for the last 100 days I have experienced this floss break about 4-6 times.
4) This container seems like it will never run out. 100 days in and I still haven’t even needed to use my refill spool that came with it.
5) Economical - given the last point, this floss will last me at least 6 months with the initial spool and the refill. Completely worth it.

"Had some problems with this design. Perhaps more an issue with the design of the coffee maker itself? Meaning, if the coffee machines coffee cup holder size is too small, you will then have an reusable coffee cut as this product, also made too small. I like a strong cup of coffee, that does NOT mean, ""use less water"" to concentrate the amount of coffee by the amount of water being used; indicative of espresso. No. That means I want to use MORE coffee per cup. Fundamental built-in flaw into the design of the model B60 Im using. Of course, the coffee maker coffee cup size dictates the size of the reusable cup as we see here. That said, the design of this cup FURTHER added to my frustration in that the design where the water is injected at the top of the cup, the lid, routes the water jet mostly to the sides, and not even enough at that. It neglects the top of the coffee cup where I can find almost dry coffee grinds. At first I tried just having to LIMIT EVEN MORE my already too limited amount of coffee so that the top of the total amount of coffee in the cup was lower...not happy. What I ended up trying was literally cut every other small piece of plastic that makes up the inbound jet on the lid; i cut them at the top and folded that little piece of plastic out...which I hoped would help jet more water upwards towards the top of the coffee line. That worked better. I would suggest this mod... Other than the fundamental cup size by Keurig, this product worked as desired, with the modification I made. I hope all that made sense....",Ergonomics

You literally either have to a) lay on your stomach at a water source and sip your brains out through the straw or b) fill up a cup and sip through that. Either way, the LifeStraw is not a great solution for getting clean water while hiking/backpacking.

Installation is too complicated because the steps given in the manual is unclear.

The pipe they have given to cover the metal rod connected to motor is very cheap and if you apply even a little extra pressure it will break

They have given a small screws to hold the pipe covering the motor which is a crap and the screw head will break easily when you tighten with the screw driver

The small size L screw driver which came along bent easily and I was required to find one from my toolset and use that. Because what they sent are of cheap quality

"I bought this in an attempt to save money over the cold brew packs that you add to water and let sit overnight.

Pros:
1. You can use any type of ground coffee you want.
2. You'll save money over buying coffee out daily.
3. Less waste than k-cups.
4. Minimal wait time over cold brew packs and no need to have space in the fridge for a pitcher.

Cons:
1. Despite using the same type and amount of coffee and same amount of water, after 30 days of use my coffee tastes watered down almost immediately now.
2. There is no drip tray. Even switching the lever to off, it still drips onto your counters.
3. The basket that the filter goes into isn't very secure and doesn't ""lock"" into the machine.
4. Total time; filling with water, filling the tumbler with ice, adding ground coffee to the basket, letting it brew and then adding your creamer and/or sugar is about 8 minutes. (Coming from cold brew packs this feels like an eternity.)

If your someone who likes a larger amount of coffee in the morning and then a smaller amount in the afternoon, there is no option to make a smaller cup of it (unless you put the rest in the fridge).

"I purchased this after searching on Amazon for ""spice infuser"" which I intend to use in pickling this summer. The measurements posted on the site are accurate and I should have used a ruler to see what I was going to get because the actual product was smaller than I imagined. (See my photo of one infuser next to a standard teaspoon.) I'm glad that I bought the two-pack; I expect that I will have to use both infusers to get an adequate seasoning of my pickle brine. These infusers appear to be fine for making a cup of tea or two, but no more. After making a single cup using a scant teaspoon of leaves, the basket was absolutely packed with wet tea leaves. The mesh on the side walls is extremely fine, so tea leaves should not get lodged in them to clog the pores. The holes at the top are a bit larger than those on the side walls, but small enough that tea leaves will not leak into your brew. They are so small, however, that it may require repeated dunking in the cup to allow all the air to escape from around the tea leaves so that the leaves are fully immersed and steeping. The hanging chain and hook appear to be sturdy and the lid is sturdier than the basket itself. I appreciate that the screw-on-cap secures to the cylinder to create a firmer seal than my old tea infusers. The drainage saucer is simply a piece of stamped metal and very shallow. I expect that the only thing that will keep tea from spilling over onto the counter as the infuser drains into it is the surface tension of the liquid. My saucers did not have edges sharp enough to cut me, but a slight variation in the manufacturing process could cause the cutting hazard that another reviewer described. I hope that the edge of the cylinder seal is more sturdy than it looks. It appears to be stamped or soldered in six places to seal it. I fear that the edges may separate after a moderate period of use. When the overall quality of this product is considered, I could imagine that if they were sold individually at the Dollar Store, the manufacturer would still make a decent profit.",Safety

 I really wanted to like this. I like the idea behind the company and I am trying to avoid single-use plastics. However, this just didn't pan out.

And the other bottle just keeps leaking, though I'm not sure from where. Every time I pick it up, there's a puddle underneath.

Sorry for the wobbly video, I was trying to show that I toggled the spray bottle off and then on again.

+ Only need water

- Leaking bottle

"This product is the Green Works Compostable Wipes repackaged and renamed. I have been buying these for years. My Amazon history shows my first purchase in 2015, but that was after I could no longer find them in the stores. Originally Green Works was Clorox Green Works and I could buy them locally. But once Clorox dropped the brand, I could only buy them online. Even had a automatic shipment set up. Lucky me as I happened to receive a package of six in December 2019 which managed to last through 2020 into 2021. But when I tried buying them again, they were no where to be found. I saw these from Clorox and wondered if they could be at least similar. Not only are they similar, they are the exact same product with a new name and packaging.

What I love about these wipes is the feel. They don't have that slimy wax paper feel that regular wipes have. These feel more like a paper towel. I've used them for so long because we have cats and I am constantly cleaning up after them. I wanted something without harmful chemicals that I could use around their food, toys, beds and litter boxes and have been pleased with these, in all incarnations, for around eight years.",Safety

The biggest problem was the smell...it was like burnt plastic and sulfur. When I opened the package for the first time inside the venue, people on the other side of the room could smell it. After airing out overnight they lost all of the bad smell so, maybe just don't wait till the last minute to open them like I did.

"I've owned this light now for 13 months and I just took it out to use it because we lost our electricity for the day. Upon inflating it I could hear air being released. I looked and there was a little tiny hole in the plastic. I'm disappointed that the plastic on this is so soft that it can be easily punctured. Most of the time that I've had it I've kept it in storage in a bag unfortunately it's out of warranty. And I can't ask for it to be replaced. If I get a puncture in this with it just being in storage how can it possibly last when I'm out camping and it's in a backpack.....well it won't. I love the concept of this product the light is very bright it charges reasonably well but you know I won't buy another one of these I'll go to another manufacturer and get something more durable.

"I was excited to have these for some coffee I received as a gift. I filled the cup as directed. As I awaited the first cup of yummy coffee to be made, instead of coffees going into my cup, it began coming out of the k-cup area and spilled all over my counter. I cleaned everything and filled another pod as directed. I took it to work and prepared for a mess but hoped for the best when I tried it in the Kurig at work. It worked like a charm! No problem. So I filled a pod as directed and tried again at home in my Kurig. Again a mess was made. I’m not sure why this happens but I’ve been taking the pods to work and have had no issues. I continue to use store bought k-cups in my home Kurig and have no issues. So I guess use with this in mind and do not use unattended.",Interference

"Pro's:
- Very lightweight and packs small
- Uses the sun to charge it
- Loops for hanging on various items

Con's:
- Not very durable
- Not very bright

So, if you are looking for something super lightweight that packs down to a small size, this is perfect. It only weights 5.44 ounces, and it packs to about the size of a small cup saucer. You will hardly notice it in your pack when carrying it. Another nice feature of this is that it is solar powered, so you don't have to worry about running out of battery power. Just loop it to the back of your pack with the light's loops, and you can charge it as you hike. These are great features in this little light.

However, this light has some serious downsides in my eyes. The material that it is made out of just feels really soft and flimsy. I just don't see it really holding up well walking in the woods. It seems to me that it would be really easy to poke this with a thorn accidentally and just ruin the whole thing. Also, it really is not that bright. Even on the brightest setting, it did not put out much light. You would not be able to use it for much other than to light the small immediately surrounding area. For that reason, I don't see much need to even carry this light on a hike. I'd say go with something else.

I had to change this thing twice a day, so was running out of placement options since my skin was so raw and irritated. I tried these bamboo bandages, hoping they would not irritate my skin… unfortunately, they still caused redness and irritation. On a positive note, they are extremely sticky and had ultimate staying power. They were almost too sticky, and difficult to peel off. My daughter has used them on her knees after she took a spill on her bike, and she really likes them- especially the coverage and that they don’t fall off at school all day.
