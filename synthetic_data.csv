"I only tried once and it wasn't the ideal scenario. Kinda low creek. Kinda rocky, muddy shoreline. Couldn't lay down or crouch really easily. You have to get way down to use so unless it is a certain scenario, it is not ideal. Plus there is a kinda counter suction that empties the well out when you're done or something but you do have to suck to pull water. I wish there was a counterweighted hose filter that pulls water out of the creek and fills a container if that makes sense.",Ergonomics
"These arrived well packaged and look like they're good quality, but upon trying them I realized they're not for me. Maybe it's just because I have a small mouth /and/ my teeth are sensitive... but the brush felt bulky and uncomfortable in my mouth and tasted a little odd. Just not my thing.",Ergonomics
"Sure these are soft and washable makeup removal pads, but they don't have any added texture (on one or both sides) for a soft exfoliating feel after the makeup is removed. They are too flimsy to hold their shape making them difficult to use.",Ergonomics
"These bamboo containers are beautiful but they break easily. I was so happy with the purchase, look great and are easily to clean. Since I bought them 2 have broken! They just slipped out of my hand and shattered. They are very slippery when washing them by hand. I have another type of glass containers and they have slipped out of my hand but have not shattered as the bamboo does. They just break too easily. I would not buy them again. They are pretty but break too fast.",Ergonomics
"So this TP is better than some other ones we've tried (Who Gives a Crap), but it is certainly not a charmin or a cottonelle. It is thinner than either of those two popular brands, but it's better for the environment so that is the trade off. Overall it's pretty good, we will probably continue to use it.",Ergonomics
"This is a handy and creative device. I dont know how well it works for mucus. I bought it to dab eyes. It does a decent job at that and the holder is good at its job. They could be a little softer for eye use but I think they will soften with use and washing. I cant say how these would treat your nose if you were really sick. For day to day use though, great idea.",Ergonomics
"I have rhinitis (just means my nose drips all the time - not mucus, just drips), so I moved away from disposables years ago. I have a hankie in a pocket of most of my clothes that have pockets. I have some beautiful designer hankies, but I also like plain, white, small ones that don't take up much space. I also prefer things that are organic, so I was excited to find these. These are a great size and pretty functional. However, the fabric is just a little thick for folding and using. I waited to write this until I washed them a couple times to see if they would soften up, but they haven't so far. I do use them, but I prefer the thinner fabric of Vermont Country Store's Women's Embroidered Cotton Handkerchiefs, Set Of 12 in white, 11"" square. I wish I had a combo of these two: the smaller, unembroidered organic cotton ""tissues,"" in a slightly thinner fabric. I'm being generous with a 4* - I wouldn't buy them again unless they make a thinner fabric.",Ergonomics
The little holder is nice but is too big for a pocket and the clothes are rough and tiny. I don't think they are worth the money at all. I will cut up some flannel and make it work. These are very hard on the nose.,Ergonomics

"I found this floss an excellent replacement for the plastic wax floss I used to buy. The crest floss I have used for years used to snap occasionally, but this floss, despite being thinner and feeling finer, hasn't broken once yet. I've only used it for a couple months though, so months vs years is hardly a good comparison. The flavor is light, more like a hint of mint. I don't have any issues sliding between my teeth. Actually being thinner, it's a litter easier to use. Overall I feel it works just as well as the plastic floss. Only a minor concern is the spot where the floss comes out of the top of the bottle is right next to the metal sliver so you have this super tiny thread just sticking out. It's not terrible to keep it from falling back in the bottle, but it does happen. I have started pulling extra out to lay onto before snapping off a length of floss to give me more floss to pin with my thumb when I go to use it again.",Ergonomics
