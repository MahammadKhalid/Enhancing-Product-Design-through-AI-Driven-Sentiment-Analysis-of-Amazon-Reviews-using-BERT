" November 11, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was amazed at the different processes for this oven. Each process comes with its own default settings for time and temperature which can be adjusted fairly easily. The oven door is hinged like a regular sized oven which adds a bit of elegance to it. I have baked in it, used the air fryer, and used the convection oven and have been very happy with each process. The lowest temperature you can set is 90 degrees and that is in dehydrate or proof modes. The highest is 450 degrees in several modes.. Ultimately I decided to give this oven a 4 star rating because of the monotonous method it uses to change your cooking mode. Each mode has a light behind it, but in order to set the oven in a particular mode, you must push the + and/or - buttons repeatedly to get to what you want. There are 18 different modes. This leaves you standing there pushing a button repeatedly several times to get it set where you want it. I would have preferred that each light have been its own button where you could just push that mode button and then set the time and temperature.. One other thing that I thought was missing is a fitted sheet pan. This is an oddly sized oven, and it comes with a drip pan, a wire rack, and an air fryer rack, but there is no flat pan for biscuits, pizza, etc. There is a setting for pizza, but not pan to put it on. I suppose you could use the crumb tray, but then you have nothing to catch the crumbs on. I am currently using the one that came with my older toaster oven, but it is too small to fit in the slots so I have to put it on the wire rack. It just seems like the addition of a sheet pan of some sort would have been appropriate.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/Kitchen-box-Convection-Countertop-Accessories/dp/B0CJC33GY9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"32 QT Digital Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, Kitchen in the box Convection Oven Countertop, 19-in-1 Smart Airfryer, Pizza Oven with, Toast Bake and Broil, Rotisserie, 6 Accessories, 1800W"

" November 21, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Yami.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I got this and traded out the old toaster oven we had. Nothing was wrong with it, but when compared to this one, this one just blew it out of the water, in looks, in sleekness, and in overall options. The fact that this is an air fryer as well come on a, rotisserie oven, a toaster, the only thing I needed to do is my laundry, and I will be in heaven! L O L. So far so good, my wife likes it, and loves that it has many options. From the picture uploaded, you can see that this thing is massive, The picture is zoomed out so that you can see the countertop space as it takes up quite a bit, but it’s nice to look at, as well as all of the options are hidden when the unit is off, and are lit up when the options selected are pressed. I like all of the options it has, has proven to be very useful, and looks good nonetheless. So far so good. This thing really is a “kitchen in the box“. Overall, I approve and recommend this product. It appears bank made very well and hope that continues to be so.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Kitchen-box-Convection-Countertop-Accessories/dp/B0CJC33GY9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"32 QT Digital Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, Kitchen in the box Convection Oven Countertop, 19-in-1 Smart Airfryer, Pizza Oven with, Toast Bake and Broil, Rotisserie, 6 Accessories, 1800W"
" November 13, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Yami.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant to order this as we recently replaced our air fryer and have a convection style oven already but I am glad we made the plunge!. This unit has several different modes, and comes with the correct racks for whichever mode you are using; this is a huge leg up in replacing multiple units in favor of just one. It is compact enough to sit on a counter but deep and wide enough to fit a 9X13 casserole dish. Cooking small pizzas, air frying French Fries/tater tots, toasting bread, and even cooking a mushroom pork chop casserole can all be done with this one oven - all cooked very evenly and retained flavor and moisture.. We don’t like using the oven in the summer as it tends to heat the house up and this is the answer to our summer needs!. Overall, an excellent investment if you want to have one unit in place of a few and totally worth the price point!",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Kitchen-box-Convection-Countertop-Accessories/dp/B0CJC33GY9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"32 QT Digital Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, Kitchen in the box Convection Oven Countertop, 19-in-1 Smart Airfryer, Pizza Oven with, Toast Bake and Broil, Rotisserie, 6 Accessories, 1800W"
" November 12, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,#NoFakeReviews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who cooks for just myself, I dislike using my full-sized oven - it seems like such a waste.. Until I got this new wonderful combination air fryer, oven, toaster, rotisserie, etc., I had a countertop oven that is used in RVs and apartments. It was about the same size as this. I liked it, but THIS IS AWESOME!. It heats up quickly, it has an easily removable crumb tray, and looks nice.. I like the shelves and the air fryer basket and the whole oven feels solid.. I have used the oven, the toast, warming and baking.. I have not yet used it for air frying, but I will soon. I am not fond of fried foods because of all the oil, so I look forward to experimenting with this!. For the next models:. Instead of having to press the + or - buttons to advance to the proper cooking mode, make each mode (oven, air fryer, rotisserie, defrost, warm, etc.) a button to press..

Multiple racks and rotisserie option. Really can cook a full multiple course meal with this. I absolutely love it. Due to the large size, you will most likely need a designated space for it. It would take up way too much countertop space for me so I have a separate area in my kitchen for it that works perfectly.

" October 24, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Rachael Seymour,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far we have used the Broil, air fry, and keep warm. Do not know if i will use the other functions as we have other things in the kitchen that do the same function but on a larger scale. Will say im interested on the ferment option and being able to cook a pizza. But we do not eat enough pizza that we have used it yet.. The Good:. The amount of things you will be able to fit while air frying is amazing. We had other air fryers in the past and this one cooks almost everything we need at one time. Very easy to clean the interior and exterior of the unit as it does not have to many parts to take apart to clean. I love the keep warm part it keeps things warm if cooking does not go to plan.. The not so good:. The fry basket is a little hard to clean due to the grate pattern. The racks/ Fry basket do not stay in the oven so you are able to take items out of them with out fully taking them out. I ended up putting foil on top of the oven going to have to find something else to keep the top clean from putting the racks there. Unit is taller then most other air fryers we have used.. Over all with the good and not so good we are enjoying it and have been able to get rid of the toaster oven and air fryer. Now we have more counter space . We are very happy with the purchase",4.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Flat-Sealed-Innovative-Accessories-CCO-R252-SUS/dp/B0C4KXHJC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI 11-in-1 26-Quart Ceramic Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, Flat-Sealed Heating Elements for Easy Cleanup, Innovative Burner Function, Christmas Gifts, 5 Accessories & Recipes, CCO-R252-SUS"
" November 11, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,White Mountain customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all this is a very good oven. It is easy to use and bakes amazingly evenly. It preheats quickly but then its flaw appears. Once you set it and it reaches the desired temperature you must hit the start button, if not it shuts off. This is very annoying to me even though the directions clearly state you must follow this process. If you are a distracted cook, this may not be the oven for you since the very subtle beep it gives when it reaches the desired temp is reached is barely noticeable in a noisy kitchen or if you are a little hard of hearing.. The other short coming is when the directions also tell you to use a certain type of scrubber on their pan, do it. I thought I used the proper cleaning scrubber, but I wore off their thinly applied non-stick coating in a flash.. I was very surprised when baking muffins in it the first time. I have always had to turn my muffin pans around to get evenly toasted muffins. This oven baked so evenly I never had to adjust the pan and the muffins were perfectly toasted no matter where they were in the pan.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Flat-Sealed-Innovative-Accessories-CCO-R252-SUS/dp/B0C4KXHJC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI 11-in-1 26-Quart Ceramic Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, Flat-Sealed Heating Elements for Easy Cleanup, Innovative Burner Function, Christmas Gifts, 5 Accessories & Recipes, CCO-R252-SUS"
" November 18, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,F,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After comparing multiple options I chose this one because of the enclosed heating elements and I am not disappointed. This air fryer is super easy to keep clean, no sharp edges, no crevices to trap grease and crumbs, just wipe it out with a sponge or paper towel and it still looks like new after a month of use.. The cook functions work well, air fryes chicken and French fries perfectly, easy reheating. Like most combo ovens using it to toast bread takes a lot longer than a dedicated toaster but it gets the job done. Broiling Bagels for 5 minutes gets them perfectly toasted on top and still warm and soft on the bottom. I was skeptical of the grilling function but it works well in a pinch.. For the size of the foot print it has a huge amount of interior space which is another plus. The large glass door is also great. Would definitely recommend to a friend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Flat-Sealed-Innovative-Accessories-CCO-R252-SUS/dp/B0C4KXHJC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI 11-in-1 26-Quart Ceramic Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, Flat-Sealed Heating Elements for Easy Cleanup, Innovative Burner Function, Christmas Gifts, 5 Accessories & Recipes, CCO-R252-SUS"
" October 20, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've been using this air fryer/toaster oven for about three weeks now. It is easy to clean. It looks very nice. Sturdy and no operational issues. One thing to note - if you want to turn off the display lights, you hold down the time/shade button for three seconds. There is an error in the instruction booklet about this and I had to call customer service (who called me back the next day with a correct answer) and do some research on amazon through the customer questions to figure out. Also - when you are heating the oven for air frying or baking, there is a three-beep chime that lets you know the oven reached its temperature. The chime is very quiet - if you're more than 15 feet away from the oven or there is other noise going on, you're not going to hear it.. We've used this oven every day since we bought it. So far we have used it for toasting, baking, reheating, and airfrying. I didn't want an oven with a rotisserie and room enough for an entire pizza - that was just over the top. This one works really well for our purposes.. The oven is rather tall - of course even though you read the dimensions, it sometimes just is bigger than you pictured. There is only about 3 inches clearance between the top of the oven and bottom of the upper cabinets. A little more snug than I would have liked but it's okay.. It cleans up very easily. Comes with a baking tray, toasting rack, and airfryer basket. Everything still looks brand new and has all been used multiple times a day every day for the past 3-4 weeks.. I did a lot of research online and surveyed about 5 close friends that owned air fryers. Very pleased with the quality and the price of this oven. Worth the effort to do the research so you get what you expect!",5.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Flat-Sealed-Innovative-Accessories-CCO-R252-SUS/dp/B0C4KXHJC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI 11-in-1 26-Quart Ceramic Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, Flat-Sealed Heating Elements for Easy Cleanup, Innovative Burner Function, Christmas Gifts, 5 Accessories & Recipes, CCO-R252-SUS"
" November 6, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Terry,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Needed to replace a toaster and was intrigued with an appliance that could do the job of several. One challenge was to find one big enough to roast a chicken or bake a casserole yet small enough to fit under the cabinets. This Cosori definitely fills all those check boxes and more. So far have used toast, bake, rotisserie, and air fryer. Have noticed that times and/or temps may have to be adjusted for certain things but it’s not a big issue. The only “negative “ is the length of time it takes to toast, but it does seem to toast evenly. Looking forward to trying the dehydrate feature.. Cleaning is a bit of a challenge, but found it helps to use aluminum foil on the bottom tray and wiping down the glass door after using air fryer or rotisserie (obviously after it cools down 😉).. As for the durability-looking forward to having this for many years.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Flat-Sealed-Innovative-Accessories-CCO-R252-SUS/dp/B0C4KXHJC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI 11-in-1 26-Quart Ceramic Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, Flat-Sealed Heating Elements for Easy Cleanup, Innovative Burner Function, Christmas Gifts, 5 Accessories & Recipes, CCO-R252-SUS"

It doesn't take long to preheat the oven functions although it does take longer to preheat the toaster function. I tried making zucchini chips with the air fryer and burned them. I tried 3 attempts at different temps and times. I need to keep trying on the air fryer. I wish Cosori had a detailed cookbook with recipes using all the different functions. I can't find anything on YouTube or the internet with recipes for this particular model. I am not experienced in air fryer, dehydration or sous vide cooking. The recipe book that comes with the 26 quart Cosori is not very helpful. I haven't tried the meat thermometer yet so will add info on that later. This toaster air fryer is so very easy to clean because of the ceramic heating unit on the bottom and top of the oven. I wait until the next day after it has cooled and take a damp cloth to clean the inside.

I have made some of the BEST dinners in this little oven - air fried pork chops (PERFECT!), baked salmon (chefs kiss; so good!), chicken, potatoes, etc. Things that I thought I’ve always made well are now easier & often BETTER in this oven. And it doesn’t heat up my whole kitchen & is super easy to clean up. Oh, and I had a similar Breville oven that this one replaced - and I’m a little salty about that….this oven is about half the price that I paid for the other one and MUCH better!. I know other reviewers don’t like the quiet beeps that it makes - I LOVE that it’s quieter. I also downloaded the app & like that I can manage it with the app. It would have been nice for them to have better labeled how to power it off (press & hold the time button), but I just marked mine with red sharpie so people know that’s also the power-off button..

" October 20, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Connie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I think I like this ceramic 11 in 1 air fryer oven. Ceramic ovens are better. Still learning how to use all the options & settings. Used it the1st time today just to do something simple while reading the instructions & learning about the settings. Became alarmed when reading P.3 of instruction booklet: 1800 watts! On the Amazon description it says 1500 watts. Why is it important? Because 1500 is the max for most common household wall outlets. I would NOT have ordered it if it had said 1800 on the ad description! My kitchen wall sockets are standard 15amp (1500vwatt) outlets, as in most homes. I had a safety outlet circuit protector that prevents outlet overloads & other circuit fire issues that plugs into an outlet & then the appliance plugs into it. So I plugged that in the outlet 1st & then the oven plug into that @ the moment to test this oven's wattage demand. At 350 degrees for 15 min's it did not trip the overload or over heated outlet switch. I haven't tried 400 or 450 degree settings yet to see it that increases the wattage use & trips the safety switch I'm using to test this oven for safety. Makes me very nervous that this oven could be a fire hazard for the wall wiring. So which is it, 1500 or 1800 watts? I will definitely be feeling the plug, outlet, & wall to make sure they don't heat up, don't smoke or melt, don't trip the breaker box, & don't trip my outlet safety gadget. Not certain if I'll keep the oven because of this. If 1500, then I'd keep it & still be cautious since that's the max wattage the outlets are rated for. If I knew for sure it's 1800watts, then no, I wouldn't chance a wall fire! The descepancy in wattage description for this oven is confusing, concerning, & serious. Fires are serious business! I have a feeling the 1800 is what thos oven really draws since I passed up a similar multi use oven (Ninga) because it was 1800 watts. I have a corsori 2 qt oressure cooker for 1 or 2 people & love it. Love that this oven is ceramic too. Saw that the poor reviews were for a non-ceramic oven & the ceramic oven verified customers reviews were all 5 star. I do like Corsori as a brand. The oven looks perfect & very versatile. My only concern is the wattage discrepancy. I'll definitely update this review if it trips the safety device, breaker box, or heats up @ the plug/ outlet/ or wall around the outlet.",3.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Flat-Sealed-Innovative-Accessories-CCO-R252-SUS/dp/B0C4KXHJC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI 11-in-1 26-Quart Ceramic Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, Flat-Sealed Heating Elements for Easy Cleanup, Innovative Burner Function, Christmas Gifts, 5 Accessories & Recipes, CCO-R252-SUS"
" September 22, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Connie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I'm mostly happy with this. It works great for making toast, for broiling, air frying, re-heating, etc. I'm not a fan of the turn-off method. There is no lettering on that button and you have to press it 3 times in a row to turn off the appliance. I think the company needs to fine-tune the controls. But I'm used to them now, so it's less of an issue (although guests have problems figuring that out). Also, it is VERY loud and kind of shakes when it's air frying, no idea if all air fryers do that! It has what looks like a stainless steel interior (rather than non-stick), so down the road I don't know if it will be easy enough to clean. And the heating rods at the top don't seem to be removable, so cleaning the ""ceiling"" might be an issue. Thus the 4-star review for cleaning and the turn-off issue. But we haven't had to clean it yet, so maybe it will be OK.

" April 29, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,c.t. bradley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been a couple of months since I bought my Cosori air fryer. I did a couple months of research before buying this model, after purchasing a full sized Cosori convection oven for my daughter's family as a house-warming gift. They really Love their family size Cosori, and I'm rather happy with my own smaller unit as well. I only use it every couple of weeks, since I eat pretty healthy, and still prefer to do my meat and veggies on a gas grill. Originally I bought this because I Love fried fish (I think fish ALWAYS tastes best when it's deep fried). I also wanted to try making healthier egg rolls and wontons. I have to say that the egg rolls and wontons turn out quite well, without having all the grease of deep frying and the cleanup and disposal issues related to deep frying. I'm still playing around with temps and times, but I am impressed with how the food turns out. Things cook much quicker in a convection oven than they do in a regular one, and the smaller size of my Cosori unit means I don't have to heat up my kitchen oven just to cook for one person. The controls are easy to use, and I really like the 'halfway timer' that lets me know when to flip my food. Overall, I think the design of the unit is quite well thought out. I love the link to online recipes and the fact that my phone keeps track of my cooking. Very, very handy! Compared to cooking on a gas grill, I still like the gas grill for roasting vegetables better than using the convection oven. Like others have said, the food still doesn't taste like deep fried - but it is certainly a healthier option that gives you a crispy outer layer while cooking the inside to perfection. I'm still playing around with air frying breaded fish fillets. I haven't perfected that yet. The conventional oven still gives me better results, but I think it's just a matter of time before I hit on the right time/temp/methods to use in my Cosori. I am very pleased with this unit and would highly recommend the Cosori brand. I included two pics of egg rolls I made, and was very happy with the results. I just may have to do some air frying tonight!",4.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Functions-Dishwasher-Safe-Accessories-Dehydrate/dp/B0B59D1J98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI Air Fryer Toaster Oven Combo, 10 Qt Family Size, 14-in-1 Functions with Dehydrate, Roast, Smart Control Through Phone & Voice, 1000+ In-APP Recipes & 6 Dishwasher -Safe Accessories, Black"

It is the perfect size for mid-quantity meals, meaning quick and uniform heating. Much bigger than pull-out fryers but not so big as ""ovens"" that take so long to heat and produce uneven results.. AND since this fryer will go to 450 degrees - 50 degrees higher than many fryers - you can set it at 415 and crisp up leftovers or reheat leftovers to the perfect consistency and taste.. This baloney that it is hard to learn the controls - not true at all. Very easy. In fact, I prefer these controls over any other fryer I have had.

" October 15, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Madicyn,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really enjoy this oven. Air frying is definitely worth the hype. I wasn’t sure before getting this but my goodness. It almost makes a frozen pizza taste fresh! And as an Italian from Philly, I take my pizzas seriously and do not say that lightly! Haha…. There is a slight issue for me with setting the timer. I just think because it’s a knob that you turn, it’s not always easy to set the exact time you want. But this is not make or break for me. The fact that I can roast, rotisserie, air fry, make delicious pizzas, etc definitely makes up for this small issue.. It was just a bit of a learning curve in understanding how this oven works. Still to this day, I overcook things! But this is not the oven’s fault, imho. It’s so powerful and works so well, there’s often discrepancies in time & this oven is done cooking much faster than you realize. (It may also be because I often choose to simply air fry over traditional bake, which is obviously MY error).. But once you hit the sweet spot, the food cooked in this thing is delicious. I think it’s well worth the cost and the learning curve. There are also some good YouTube videos on it to understand it more.

" June 29, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Benjamin Kent,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is nice mid-size toaster oven/air fryer built for a typical family of 3-4 people. It has Air Fry/ Air Broil/ Air Roast/ Rotisserie and Bake functions in addition to keep warm and several other pre-set functions. There are quite lot of features and functions available, and you won't miss any function.. We have been using a Farberware AirFyer/ Toaster oven that started tripping circuit after 3 to 4 years of daily use. So Comfee replaced that. So, it was easy to use functions without referring to its manual. Here are key points:. + Comfee has many functions and it has every feature that you can imagine and will need. So good at that way. Presets makes it quite easy for lay users to set and cook.. + It distributes temperature quite well, and cooking has been consistently good. Electronic Cooling fan automatically comes and stops when needed. It is clearly noticeable when running, but is not loud as to bother you.. + Has a pre-heat function that runs before the actual cooking program begins. That is nice but you need to keep an eye as there is no warning or pre-signal when preheating is about to end so that you can put the actual food tray in.. + Has a squarish tray with 11.5"" X 10.75"""" surface area (actual size with edges more like 12.5""X11.5""). This takes 11"" casserole dish. That works great for us. Unlike some bigger units (30+ liter volume), it will not fit larger 13 inch casserole dish if you have a larger family to feed/cook on daily basis. Bigger Farberware oven, it replaced had almost like 14.5 inch long tray, but took more counter space too. Make your choice!. + You can cook at two levels simultaneously (like a tray + wire mess by separating two different items) at two different levels which we couldn't do in Farberware. This feature can be quite useful at times as you can separate items and cook.. + This is a counter top oven and you can cook a small chicken or chicken piece (less than 4lb) in rotissiery. We haven't tried yet but have no reason to believe it won't do a good job.. + Build quality of unit is good; tray and other accessories look good and well made. The Unit looks good and will fit decor of most kitchens.. In short, a good value for a well made unit, with lots of features.

" November 19, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Kai Starr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought this oven to replace our failing HB countertop oven. This one has all the functions of the old one, plus some! I wasn't sure how we would like this oven, but the numerous good reviews helped make up my mind. I'm glad we got it, because it has already outperformed the old oven, in every way. It even outperforms our humongous full-size gas oven!. First, let me just say that the controls are strange. It has all these settings on the control panel, but you can't just push one to select it, as you can with some other ovens. You have to ""scroll"" through the presets, the temps, the time, using the + and - buttons. You can push the temp and time buttons to switch to those controls, but still need to use the + and - to get to the time and temp you want. It's odd, but we got used to it fairly quickly, so it wasn't that big of a deal. Also, for US folks, the ""chip"" function is for fries. Just FYI.. It hasn't got a long power cord, so unless you're putting it right next to an outlet, you will have to get a heavy-duty appliance extension cord. Make sure you get one that is rated for more than 1800 watts, or it will melt and cause a fire. The unit needs a good bit of power!. As far as cooking goes, this thing rocks! We baked our taco shells in it, and they came out super crispy and delicious. Fries came out just as we like them, without any special prep. Baked up a frozen pizza and air-fried some frozen chimichangas, toasted some cheese sandwiches, and air-fried chicken drumsticks, and all of it came out great. The crispiness is something our other oven just couldn't match, and neither has any other oven we have owned. It also doesn't heat up the kitchen, which is a great benefit of a small countertop appliance.. It's an attractive unit, with black casing and stainless steel door handle, so it goes with all of our other appliances. The door closes securely and doesn't seem to leak much heat (a problem we had with all of our previous countertop ovens), and the unit itself stays relatively cool. It gets slightly warm to the touch, but the real heat comes out the vent at the back, so be sure not to put anything close to that vent that could ignite or melt. Ours is sitting about 6 inches from the wall in back, so the wall doesn't even get warm. However, we have a towel rack on that wall, a few feet above the oven, and the vent's heat helps to dry those towels faster than normal. That's an unexpected plus, for us.. We haven't used the rotisserie or the dehydrate functions yet (and probably won't for the dehydrator, as we have a stand-alone unit that can do a LOT of food at once), but plan on using the rotisserie for our Thanksgiving turkey roast. The previous unit did a pretty good job of rotisserie cooking, but I couldn't find any chickens small enough to fit it, so all we could do on it was Cornish hens and small roasts. This unit can do a larger bird, and the 3-lb breast roast should be a snap for it.. Sadly, I didn't realize I only had 7 days to get the extended warranty, so missed out on that. If this is truly comparable to other ovens we have had, it should last a few years anyway. We do use it a couple times a day, as it's so convenient, so I hope it will last a while.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Beelicious-Rotisserie-Dehydrator-Countertop-Accessories/dp/B09871GCN1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Beelicious 32QT Extra Large Air Fryer, 19-In-1 Air Fryer Toaster Oven Combo with Rotisserie and Dehydrator, Digital Convection Oven Countertop Airfryer Fit 13"" Pizza, 6 Accessories, 1800w, Black"

It can do a lot, from dehydrating, to baking, to rotisserie. It's very versatile. Cleaning is not the easiest, but also not impossible. There are a lot off grooves and areas where grease can get trapped. Controls are easy to use and nothing about it is overly complicated. There are how ever a few draw backs. For starters the oven takes a longer time to heat up over your standard basket airfryer. About 2-5 minuets. When cooking fatty meats the over does produce smoke and unlike your standard oven there is no ventilation, so you will need to place it buy a vent/window.. All in all its a great little oven. I will say this. If you're looking for just an airfyer to cook french fries and chicken wings really quick, this probably isnt for you.

" November 25, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Michael,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my Combi Oven a few days ago and will share what I perceive as the pros and cons about this oven.. It is not a toaster oven, it isn't a tiny thing with limited functionality, it is a combination oven with a number of features that in the past required separate appliances for each.. I had some specific features I was looking for when buying an oven. I wanted temperatures that went low enough to dehydrate and proof and times long enough to ferment/culture. I wanted temperatures that went high enough to sear, bake, etc. I wanted all the various cooking styles, bake, roast, convection/air-fry, broil, dehydrate etc. I wanted rotisserie so I could make chicken that isn't injected with pounds of salt. I also wanted to see if this could replace my big oven, there is only two of us. I wanted simplicity and not 12 different appliances to dig out.. PROS: This oven does all of that. And while oven does not have a steam function, you can even add water in one of the trays and place in bottom for baking.. When I unboxed, it had a slight smell. I ran the suggested bake-off cycle and was pleasantly surprised there was no smell as I had read in reviews of other ovens.. I have made toast, (takes longer than toaster) cookies, and a casserole. Pre-heating is much faster than my air fryer. Everything cooked perfectly so far.. The exterior of the oven is not hot to the touch while cooking, warm yes, not hot. The air coming out of it while cooking is not as hot as the small air-fryer I had.. I feel that it is sturdy and will last many years. While a bit tinny sounding when moving racks in and out, it seems to be of good quality. Door closes very well and while not heavy seems very substantial.. CONS: I am not fond of touch screen. I wish it had a dial for functions. The next thing that I absolutely hate is the pre-sets mixed in with functions. For instance it has a pre-set for cookies which is the same as bake and you still have to set the temp and time for the pre-set. Then there is a pre-set for wings which is the convection/air-fry function. Why not have functions and not pre-sets which just confuses the situation. A pre-set is not a function. So, in this case, pre-sets are just redundant. For instance: I saw someone ask if you could make yogurt in this appliance and the response was no. The person answering obviously thought because it didn't have a pre-set for yogurt that it couldn't do it. But it can in the proof mode, temp is low enough and time can go long enough.. So would I buy again. YES! It does everything I want and need it to. It does everything that I want it to and no other oven on Amazon or elsewhere did all I needed it to with all the functions provided by this oven.. Two suggestions, one buy the silicone mini mitts available here on Amazon and remember it isn't like a regular oven, so set up racks before heating. Unlike big oven where you can change the rack after heating up, the racks in this will be hot and you will have to find a place to set and let cool. Okay, a third one, always buy the insurance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Beelicious-Rotisserie-Dehydrator-Countertop-Accessories/dp/B09871GCN1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Beelicious 32QT Extra Large Air Fryer, 19-In-1 Air Fryer Toaster Oven Combo with Rotisserie and Dehydrator, Digital Convection Oven Countertop Airfryer Fit 13"" Pizza, 6 Accessories, 1800w, Black"

Then I discovered the Beelicious bigger version, read reviews of those who had actually used the rotisserie for up to 10 lb chickens, and how amazingly well it turned out, the easy cleanup, how fast it sped up the overall rotisserie process, so I jumped on it. I've baked, broiled, toasted, and just used the rotisserie with an 8 lb. chicken and it has been amazing! Everything has turned out wonderful! I did banana bread (to die for as it was moist like banana cake), pizza, hamburgers with cheese (even toasted the sesame buns!), broiled hot dogs like on the grill (even got the cool grill stripes on them), cake, brownies (killer moist and not overdone), a roast (juicy yummy), and finally the rotisserie chicken. Omgosh, it was perfect!!! Juicy, done just right, not one issue with trussing and keeping it balanced perfectly on the rotisserie spit. That's really the trick. If it's trussed correctly with nothing sticking out including wing tips, legs and tail, and if it's perfectly pierced into the breast meat right at the shoulders with the spit properly secured and the chicken is dead in the center of the spit, it will cook without flopping and will rotate absolutely perfectly. It came out a lovely golden crispy brown, and oh so delicious. I have had no issues with this air fryer. Everything has come out evenly cooked or baked, even when toasting or doing pizza. It is a true mini oven but it accommodates all my big dishes, even the 9x18. I absolutely love this item, and it is the first out of 3 to be perfect in every way. So easy to clean, too. Super dooper happy!!! And let me tell you, I went over the reviews on dozens of these things before I decided on the Beelicious. I don't like paid for, or free item reviews because really, it's very hard to not be biased if someone gives you a $300 appliance. So I stuck to standard reviews, and I always take in the bad reviews as well to see if they are a major downfall, or just some whiny little inconvenience like a missing part which can be fixed. I want to know if it works. I don't care if the color isn't perfect, it took too long to arrive, or it doesn't fit with my decor. I just want to be sure it works. That's how I narrowed down to the Beelicious, as it has some of the highest ratings on the internet for a newcomer. Well, it earned it's big star reviews. I am very pleased! I did see a lot of folks wanting dials instead of digital. Meh! I'm 68 and dumber than a rock when it comes to technology, but even I figured this one out. To me dials are not imperative.

" October 27, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,FTPC88,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For context, I am a former professional line cook and currently provide dining services :) to my family on a daily basis.. I was looking to replace a dead 4 qt. air fryer but wanted a multi-function unit for the following reasons: 1) my home oven takes ~17 minutes to preheat to 350F, 2) currently lack convenience of a toaster oven 3) I have limited counter space.. I have had this Cosari 12 in 1 for less than a week but have used it every day. Here is what I've done and the associated experience/results:. 1) Air fryer function: frozen chicken nuggets + frozen crinkle cut fries - the unit was to temp (360F) within 2 minutes. Loaded the fryer tray with both nuggets and fries. 9 min cook time. Everything came out evenly browned and crisp. The unit was also surprisingly quiet. Much quieter than my last unit. Score- Air Fry - 10.. 2) Convection Bake function: Re-heated pre-cooked thick cut bacon. I pre-cook and keep thick cut bacon in the fridge at all times. Normally, I would re-heat via microwave (soggy) or on a cast iron skillet. I slid 4 slices into the Cosari, set to bake 400F with fan (convection). WIthin 2 minutes, the bacon was sizzling and crisped up in more than half the time vs the cast iron. Score - convection - 10.. 3) Bake function: Re-heated slices of both thin crust and thick crust pizza. I make tradional NY style thin crust as well as a thicker sheet pan style pie. Left overs are frozen and pulled for a quick after school (or late night!) snack. Previously, I would preheat the oven to 375F and the slices would take 8-10 minutes to be hot and ready. In the Cosari, I set it to Bake at 400F. Preheated for the amount of time it took to pull the slices and arrange on a parchment lined pan. Maybe 2 minutes. Bake time was 8 minutes to perfection. I really think the limited interior space vs a conventional oven allows a higher concentration of heat enabling a faster cook from frozen. Maybe not, don't really know. What I do know, I give the Cosari another score of 10 for this baking application.. 4) Warming function: I have previously used my standard oven for holding foods hot when hosting and serving larger groups. I was preparing a breakfast taco bar for 10ppl and decided to try the Cosari to hold hot foods hot. I set the warming function at 220F and loaded in cold cooked bacon, pan fried breakfast potatoes and a pan of scrambled eggs. This gave me the time to warm tortillas on the cast iron skillet, lay out the spread of cold toppings and call everyone to the kitchen. I pulled everything out of the Cosari after about 10 mins and everything was perfect. Super convenient and effective. Warming function score: 10.. 5) Broil function: On occasion we treat ourselves with buttered texas toast with cinnamon and sugar bruleed under the broiler. Popped a couple of slices into the Cosari, broil setting on 400F for 2 minutes. Being able to turn the light on without opening the door is a great feature to guard against burning the sugary sweet treat. Perfection. Broil function: 10.. I have yet to use the dehydration function but plan to with some near end of life bananas. I also have yet to use it to bake (or convection bake) or roast a substantial amount of meat.. Overall Pros: My expectations were met and exceeded in some areas with this unit. It looks good and comes with the necessary rack, broiler pan and air fryer tray. Note: 2, standard 1/8 aluminum sheet pans fit perfectly on the included broiler pan which is very handy. A 12"" pizza round also fits inside perfectly. Super versatile unit & highly efficient. The control panel is easy to use. Also, the chime is not overbearingly loud or annoying.. Overall Cons: The control knob on my unit feels loose. It turn with incremental notches that can be felt though the function and temp displays aren't sync'd with the notches. In other words, the going from 350F to 355F is halfway between two notches. Weird. It may have been put on incorrectly. I hope it lasts. Also, the door which drops down is spring loaded assisted to close. It is quite tight and has slipped out of my hand a couple of times slamming shut. I don't think that will help the longevity so something to take notice of and avoid letting the door slam shut. I will say, the handle is perfectly positioned whereas then the door is open, the handle serves to keep the open lid at a 90 degree angle allowing for the opened door to serve as a temporary landing shelf.. If the rating system allowed, I would rate this a 4.5. I can't give it a five because of the knob issue though so far, I love this unit. My wife refers to it as my new little friend.. I hope this review is helpful.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Convection-Countertop-Accessories-CS100-AO/dp/B08K8T3W2V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, 12-in-1, 26QT Convection Oven Countertop, Christmas Gifts,with Toast, Bake, and Broil, Smart, 6 Slice Toast, 12'' Pizza, 75 Recipes&Accessories, Black"
" October 22, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Dave P,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd Cosori Toaster Oven, the 1st a CO130. We have not used the gas oven since the 1st purchase. This one fits better on the counter & has a better control panel. But, the OFF button is not visible, must press either the Time or Start button for 3 seconds to completely turn off the oven. More troubling is the audible beeps at the conclusion of functions. The beep is so faint unless you're about 6"" from the oven it is inaudible. I found this an important feature on CO130 & even more so on this one since when the Preheat function is completed it automatically begins the Heat function. And also when the Heat function is completed all there is the screen showing End. This is a madding situation when you're busy with other cooking activities.. Still undecided whether to return this oven because there are also a number of improvements. Much easier to clean. I like the improvements to the control panel & that it is on the top of the oven. It cooks more evenly with 4 heating elements on top rather than 2. It also cooks food quicker which takes a little more attention. The light goes on when you open the door. With the control panel & fans on the top of oven it seems to be cooler on the outside, but watchout for the glass door it does get hot.. If you carefully read the manual it does mention how to completely turn the oven off, but it also talks about the Beeps between functions which are totally inaudible.. I'm updating & upgrading my rating due to a Firmware Update which increased the beeps to an audible level. This has made cooking much easier to monitor.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Convection-Countertop-Accessories-CS100-AO/dp/B08K8T3W2V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, 12-in-1, 26QT Convection Oven Countertop, Christmas Gifts,with Toast, Bake, and Broil, Smart, 6 Slice Toast, 12'' Pizza, 75 Recipes&Accessories, Black"

" September 21, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Johnnie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I live in an apartment where everything is electric, other than the gas heater. I have vowed to not use the oven that's in the apartment after researching and seeing an average cost of around $11.00 an hour. Between my NewWave and my Cosori oven my electric bill has yet to hit the $40.00 mark. I love this oven. I started making my own bread and it comes out great . I love watching my bread dough peak over the top of the loaf pan using the Ferment feature. Making sure to shake away crumbs before air frying loose items, like French fries helps to keep the inside spotless. Aluminum foil is definitely for those items that cant be placed in a covered cooking vessel. I make a lot of ""from scratch"" pizzas in it and again, could not be happier with how they come out. I've also used the dehydrator function to my delight. If you love to cook,or are looking to make things yourself, instead of buying them this is great oven to do just that. Another thing I like is that the oven does not blair out loud annoying beeps when the cooking time completes. It makes a few beeps to let you know the cooking time has completed, and not make it sound like a 3 alarm fire..

" November 5, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,WaydeG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I see most of the small kitchen appliances like the InstaPot, expensive programmable rice cookers and specialty ovens as gadgets that do perform well but often not well enough to make it off the shelf enough to justify the expense. Like my sous vide, it works very well but not quite as convenient as I'd hoped. I thought the air fryer was just that, a fad or craze. My initial InstaPot airfryer left a lingering plastic odor and got sent back. The Cosori was recommended and on sale so I took a chance. I've had (and frequently used) it for the last 6 months and I stand corrected.. We in fact, use it 2-3 times per week. Chicken wings, thighs, reheating pizza, shepherd's pie, biscuits, fish, fries, turovers, tots, french bread pizza, homemade donuts, bacon and the list goes on. Especially good for snacks (grandkids) you would normally do in an oven like taquitos, pizza rolls, mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders only much faster. Add a silicone baking dish and you expand the possibilities even more. The Cosori heats up quickly, is easy to clean and the two-piece basket is big enough to cook for 2-3 adults. I can have a meal on the table in under 20 minutes and they are delicious.

" October 24, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Rachael Seymour,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far we have used the Broil, air fry, and keep warm. Do not know if i will use the other functions as we have other things in the kitchen that do the same function but on a larger scale. Will say im interested on the ferment option and being able to cook a pizza. But we do not eat enough pizza that we have used it yet.. The Good:. The amount of things you will be able to fit while air frying is amazing. We had other air fryers in the past and this one cooks almost everything we need at one time. Very easy to clean the interior and exterior of the unit as it does not have to many parts to take apart to clean. I love the keep warm part it keeps things warm if cooking does not go to plan.. The not so good:. The fry basket is a little hard to clean due to the grate pattern. The racks/ Fry basket do not stay in the oven so you are able to take items out of them with out fully taking them out.

" November 11, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,White Mountain customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all this is a very good oven. It is easy to use and bakes amazingly evenly. It preheats quickly but then its flaw appears. Once you set it and it reaches the desired temperature you must hit the start button, if not it shuts off. This is very annoying to me even though the directions clearly state you must follow this process. If you are a distracted cook, this may not be the oven for you since the very subtle beep it gives when it reaches the desired temp is reached is barely noticeable in a noisy kitchen or if you are a little hard of hearing.. The other short coming is when the directions also tell you to use a certain type of scrubber on their pan, do it. I thought I used the proper cleaning scrubber, but I wore off their thinly applied non-stick coating in a flash.. I was very surprised when baking muffins in it the first time. I have always had to turn my muffin pans around to get evenly toasted muffins. This oven baked so evenly I never had to adjust the pan and the muffins were perfectly toasted no matter where they were in the pan.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Countertop-Dehydrator-Accessories-CS130-AO/dp/B0895GS9NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI Air Fryer Toaster Oven Combo 12 Functions Smart 30L Large Countertop Dehydrator 13"" pizza, 100 Recipes & 6 Accessories Included, Work with Alexa CS130-AO, WiFi-Black"
" November 18, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,F,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After comparing multiple options I chose this one because of the enclosed heating elements and I am not disappointed. This air fryer is super easy to keep clean, no sharp edges, no crevices to trap grease and crumbs, just wipe it out with a sponge or paper towel and it still looks like new after a month of use.. The cook functions work well, air fryes chicken and French fries perfectly, easy reheating. Like most combo ovens using it to toast bread takes a lot longer than a dedicated toaster but it gets the job done. Broiling Bagels for 5 minutes gets them perfectly toasted on top and still warm and soft on the bottom. I was skeptical of the grilling function but it works well in a pinch.. For the size of the foot print it has a huge amount of interior space which is another plus. The large glass door is also great.

" October 20, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've been using this air fryer/toaster oven for about three weeks now. It is easy to clean. It looks very nice. Sturdy and no operational issues. One thing to note - if you want to turn off the display lights, you hold down the time/shade button for three seconds. There is an error in the instruction booklet about this and I had to call customer service (who called me back the next day with a correct answer) and do some research on amazon through the customer questions to figure out. Also - when you are heating the oven for air frying or baking, there is a three-beep chime that lets you know the oven reached its temperature. The chime is very quiet - if you're more than 15 feet away from the oven or there is other noise going on, you're not going to hear it.. We've used this oven every day since we bought it. So far we have used it for toasting, baking, reheating, and airfrying. I didn't want an oven with a rotisserie and room enough for an entire pizza - that was just over the top. This one works really well for our purposes.. The oven is rather tall - of course even though you read the dimensions, it sometimes just is bigger than you pictured. There is only about 3 inches clearance between the top of the oven and bottom of the upper cabinets. A little more snug than I would have liked but it's okay.. It cleans up very easily. Comes with a baking tray, toasting rack, and airfryer basket. Everything still looks brand new and has all been used multiple times a day every day for the past 3-4 weeks.. I did a lot of research online and surveyed about 5 close friends that owned air fryers. Very pleased with the quality and the price of this oven.

One challenge was to find one big enough to roast a chicken or bake a casserole yet small enough to fit under the cabinets. This Cosori definitely fills all those check boxes and more. So far have used toast, bake, rotisserie, and air fryer. Have noticed that times and/or temps may have to be adjusted for certain things but it’s not a big issue. The only “negative “ is the length of time it takes to toast, but it does seem to toast evenly. Looking forward to trying the dehydrate feature.. Cleaning is a bit of a challenge, but found it helps to use aluminum foil on the bottom tray and wiping down the glass door after using air fryer or rotisserie (obviously after it cools down 😉)..

" October 20, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Connie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I think I like this ceramic 11 in 1 air fryer oven. Ceramic ovens are better. Still learning how to use all the options & settings. Used it the1st time today just to do something simple while reading the instructions & learning about the settings. Became alarmed when reading P.3 of instruction booklet: 1800 watts! On the Amazon description it says 1500 watts. Why is it important? Because 1500 is the max for most common household wall outlets. I would NOT have ordered it if it had said 1800 on the ad description! My kitchen wall sockets are standard 15amp (1500vwatt) outlets, as in most homes. I had a safety outlet circuit protector that prevents outlet overloads & other circuit fire issues that plugs into an outlet & then the appliance plugs into it. So I plugged that in the outlet 1st & then the oven plug into that @ the moment to test this oven's wattage demand. At 350 degrees for 15 min's it did not trip the overload or over heated outlet switch. I haven't tried 400 or 450 degree settings yet to see it that increases the wattage use & trips the safety switch I'm using to test this oven for safety. Makes me very nervous that this oven could be a fire hazard for the wall wiring. So which is it, 1500 or 1800 watts? I will definitely be feeling the plug, outlet, & wall to make sure they don't heat up, don't smoke or melt, don't trip the breaker box, & don't trip my outlet safety gadget. Not certain if I'll keep the oven because of this. If 1500, then I'd keep it & still be cautious since that's the max wattage the outlets are rated for. If I knew for sure it's 1800watts, then no, I wouldn't chance a wall fire! The descepancy in wattage description for this oven is confusing, concerning, & serious. Fires are serious business! I have a feeling the 1800 is what thos oven really draws since I passed up a similar multi use oven (Ninga) because it was 1800 watts. I have a corsori 2 qt oressure cooker for 1 or 2 people & love it. Love that this oven is ceramic too. Saw that the poor reviews were for a non-ceramic oven & the ceramic oven verified customers reviews were all 5 star. I do like Corsori as a brand. The oven looks perfect & very versatile. My only concern is the wattage discrepancy.

It works great for making toast, for broiling, air frying, re-heating, etc. I'm not a fan of the turn-off method. There is no lettering on that button and you have to press it 3 times in a row to turn off the appliance. I think the company needs to fine-tune the controls. But I'm used to them now, so it's less of an issue (although guests have problems figuring that out). Also, it is VERY loud and kind of shakes when it's air frying, no idea if all air fryers do that! It has what looks like a stainless steel interior (rather than non-stick), so down the road I don't know if it will be easy enough to clean. And the heating rods at the top don't seem to be removable, so cleaning the ""ceiling"" might be an issue. Thus the 4-star review for cleaning and the turn-off issue. But we haven't had to clean it yet, so maybe it will be OK.

In terms of build, it seems kind of cheap, but I think that is just how things are these days. It gets really hot so it doesn’t keep heat inside well, and the instructions say too open the oven door with an underhand hold. I held it with an overhand hold and ended up up burning a knuckle when it contacted the top metal surface of the door. So I would be wary about use around young children and make sure you have a clear unobstructed area to put it in. That said, this oven is HUGE and is a nice replacement for our broken built in full size oven. The controls are absurdly simple. Button push the oven setting you want, then temp, time if needed, start. My mom complained there is no beeping (for feedback when you push each button) but it isn’t a microwave!

I got rid of it and spent $40+ ordering the original from a replacement parts store online.. Check your pan and inspect if coating is coming off before and after you cook. Clean gently.. Dislike #3.

" September 8, 2015",Reviewed in the United States ,NY-NC GAL,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for the Oster toaster oven that my dad has. I like that slightly better than this one. This oven is quite large, maybe a little too large, but not large enough in some respects for some pans I have, so then I would have to use the large oven.. Love that it can do convection as well as the regular oven stuff. Wish that this oven had a light in it, but it doesn't. But, otherwise, it's easy to use.. Guess my cons are:. 1. No light inside.. 2. A little too large.. 3. Can only cook for up to 90 minutes at a time. It would be nice to be able to cook for hours on this.. Pros:. 1. Large. 2. Easy digital.. 3. Easy to clean.. Update: 12/30/2018. I've now had this oven for 3.5 yrs. I still give it a 4 out of 5 star review. We use our oven nearly every day and multiple times often. Before I said it was a little too large, but it isn't. I sort of wish it was slightly larger so it would fit normal sized half sheet baking sheets.. This oven is easy to clean if you clean it close to right after any spills and after it cools down. But, if you don't clean for months, it then is really hard to clean and I'm still trying to figure out a way to get the gunk off the walls. I've used only a paste of baking soda/vinegar/water and applying it to the walls, baking at 200 F for 45 minutes. Doing this twice and using a lot of elbow grease with an abrasive scrubby pad got a lot of stuff off but still not good enough.. I'm going to contact Oster this week to see if I can use Easy Off Oven Cleaner, though I hate using any chemicals in the oven. My Crumb Tray that you can slide out is gross. You cannot cover this with aluminum foil as it will mess with the temperature of the oven. Basically you can't have any foil touching the heating elements or the sides of the walls of the inside of the oven.. I do cover foods with aluminum foil and that is fine.. The odd dimensions of this oven don't allow you to get a real half sheet which has a width of 16"". The max this oven can take is 15 5/8"", so just shy. I wish when they made this oven, they made the inner dimension able to fit the half sheet. Was able to find Jamie Oliver's baking pan at 15x10, but most other places don't have this weird size.. The baking pan that came with my Oster looks hideous. I'm trying to figure out how to clean it. Yes, my bad. Layers of burned on grease and who knows what else. Mine is black and after 2 times in the oven with my paste, and soaking in the sink in hot water, it's still mostly black. I may just need to see if Oster offers a replacement baking pan as well as Crumb Tray I can buy.. I still don't like the fact there is no light inside the oven, which would be really nice to have.. The door, if you're not careful, can swing opened real easily when you open the oven and I can see how some might be able to break the glass on the door. It hasn't happened to me, though, thankfully.. This is our MOST used appliance and has been good. The cook times can vary a little from a recipe, like sometimes 5 minutes or so give or take. The digital controls are easy to use.. Though, admittedly, I've never Toasted anything in this oven. Mainly I use BAKE and sometimes BROIL. Today, after owning it for so long, I realized it has a TURBO CONVECTION baking feature. I reduced the temp by 25 F but still baked for the same amount of time some hashbrowns this morning. My husband says he likes it this way better than regular BAKE.. Anything you would use a convention sized oven, I basically use this for my family of 4 and occasionally guests. It's enough. I do casseroles, meat, all sorts of things.. The only other things I wished this oven had besides an inside oven light are: dehydrator feature, air frying feature. If it had these 3 things, a bit easier cleaning, it would be the perfect toaster oven.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/Oster-Countertop-Toaster-Pizzas-Stainless/dp/B0977M6FJP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Oster Air Fryer Oven, 10-in-1 Countertop Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, 10.5"" x 13"" Fits 2 Large Pizzas, Stainless Steel,Silver"

" December 17, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Kris,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I’m pleased with my Cosori 6.8 Qt dual blaze. There a few things I think you guys could innovate to make slightly better, but they wouldn’t stop me from buying the product.. The first Cosori we got was the 5.8 quart. The basket fell apart after a year though - the part where the plastic front was attached to the metal basket sort of disintegrated where the screws attach. Also, it was frustrating that the drawer was on a slight tilt forward, meaning if you pulled it out even a little it continued to slide forward and down on its own, which could lead to falling if you don’t have a massive amount of counter space in front of it. I loved how versatile it was for cooking though. This definitely got me hooked on air fryers. If I had done more research I might have realized that Cosori have a 2 year guarantee, so I should have contacted the company to see if they could give me a new basket. We just went ahead and bought a new one though because I wanted it to be slightly bigger.. The new one we got is the 6.8 quart dual blaze. This one has some improvements. I don’t know if the inside coating is actually different, or if it’s just been a while since I had the old one and I”m misremembering, but this one seems easier to clean. Everything wipes out really easily. It has a removable shelf inside instead of an entire basket you lift out. The shelf is easier to clean as well. The old basket had all the holes and slats that could be difficult to get grease/debris out of.. The only issue with the shelf is taking it out. It has two holes in the center that you're supposed to put your fingers through to lift it out. However, when your food is ready and it's hot, you obviously can't do that! So you have to get the food out itself with a spatula or tongs. If you do try to tilt the entire drawer over, the shelf falls out with the food. I think it would be good to have a handle that sticks straight up in the center, with a threaded screw hole in the center of the basket. That way you could grasp it to lift it out if you were making something like fries, etc, but if you wanted to cook an entire chicken you just unscrew the handle, and voila, the shelf is flat again.. I also think they should make four divets horizontally in the corners of the drawer, so that the shelf stays put if you do want to tilt the entire drawer over to dump something out. These divets should be strong enough to hold the shelf in place for an easy tilt, but with the screw-in handle it would still be easy to exert enough force on the shelf to remove it if you wanted.. I would also recommend putting little foldable “feet” on the sides of the shelf, so that you could raise it if you wanted, and cook something both in the bottom of the drawer itself and on the shelf. Again voila - instant accessory. That to me is a major selling point, and I doubt I'm the only one that would love a built in accessory like that.. One more thing - the dual blaze has the settings of reheat, broil, bake, air fry, and roast, but it does not explain in the instruction manual how the dual burners function accordingly. Example, air fry is both burners on high, broil is top burner high, bottom burner low, etc. I had to scroll through a dozen FB posts to try to find out if somebody knew, and I still only found 4 of the six settings. These should be clearly in the instruction manual.. Both products are still great and I would still recommend them, as evidenced by the fact that I bought another Cosori :) Just tweaks that would make them even better and might get some people more sold on them.. Ps- one more pro. The new dual blaze is much quieter than the old one.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-6-8-Quart-Precise-Prevent-Overcooking/dp/B0BT9TL34D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI Pro III Air Fryer Dual Blaze, 6.8-Quart, Precise Temps Prevent Overcooking, Heating Adjusts for a True Air Fry, Bake, Roast, and Broil, Even and Fast Cooking, In-App Recipes, 1750W, Dark gray"

" June 30, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Jenifer west,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This air fryer looks and works like a mini oven, sort of like a toaster oven but it has so much more functionality. You can use it like a toaster oven to make toast or reheat last night's pizza, but you can also use it to cook a real meal since it has so many more functions than a toaster oven. My 20-year-old son is actually learning to cook with this air fryer! For whatever reason, he doesn't feel so intimidated when using this air fryer as opposed to the wall oven or the stovetop.. I like the toaster oven styling. I like that the front has a stainless steel door with a glass window so you can keep an eye on what you are cooking. This air fryer looks nice on the countertop and for as large capacity as this thing has, the overall size of it is not too big. It is a good size for even a small kitchen, I think. It is about 13.5 inches high, 13.5 inches across and about 12 .5 inches deep, The seller provides more precise measurements, but if your space will fit the dimensions above, it should fit this air fryer. The top, sides and back have air vents and when you are cooking the air coming out of themis hot, so you will want to have plenty of airflow around all sides of the oven.. As for actually cooking with this unit, the controls are fairly simple. I didn't quite figure them all out on my own; they are somehwat intuitive but the instruction book filled in what I didn't pick up by just pressing the buttons and turning the dials. The buttons, for the most part, let you choose between air fry and bake functions, and also turn on the light and start/stop heating. The dial lets you choose a precise time and temperature (or preset cooking times and temps for specific foods, but I have not used any of the presets as I prefer to follow recipes' specifed times and temperatures).. This air fryer comes with several pans and racks, as well as a crumb tray to cach spills at the bottom. I like that the oven has various slots to hold the pans or racks in different positions inside the oven, either closer to the top heating element or closer to the bottom of the unit.. Overall this air fryer works great and we love it. It is great looking and takes up less space than I thought it would, and it is very functional, whether you are roasting raw chicken breasts for a full meal, baking cookies, making ""skinny"" air-fried French fries, or just heating up a frozen pizza. This air fryer is basically like a mini oven, and while it is a great choice for any kitchen, it would be a terrific option for someone who doesn't have a kitchen, like those who live in dorm rooms, or maybe a or garage apartment that has not been fully built out.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Kalorik-Toaster-AFO-47797-SS/dp/B09BK37SCT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Kalorik MAXX® 16 Quart Digital Air Fryer Oven, 9-in-1 Versatility, Bake, Braise, Broil, Dehydrate, Grill, Roast, Sear, Toast, 21 Presets, 5 Accessories, Bonus Cookbook, 500°F, 1600W, Stainless Steel"

" July 1, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Ernie ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little Kalorik air fryer is fantastic. I got it to replace a small Cuisinart 3-in-1, and I have been very pleased to note that this Kalorik model improves on almost every single quibble I had with my previous unit.. Here's why I love it:. * Small footprint. We don't have a ton of counter space in our kitchen and the only spot we have for an air fryer is in a corner with our coffee maker. This really limits the size of any air fryer unit we might consider. This Kalorik air fryer fits perfectly in our space. And as an added bonus, it's similar in height to our coffee maker, so they look more balanced together there.. * Tall, not deep. This is great for space reasons and practical ones, as well. I can cook a small whole chicken in this unit, which is something I could never dream of doing with my Cusinart. This also makes it much easier to clean. I'm short and I have tiny t-rex arms. It was basically impossible to reach the back of my old unit to clean it. This one is SO much easier to wipe down after use.. * Light inside! This is a huge step up. And it came in really handy when I made Shrinky Dinks with my kids recently. They got such a kick out of watching that transformation!. * Fits most of my air fryer sized pans and sheets. (Not all, which is kind of a bummer, but most!). * Easy to use controls that allow for a wide range of temps. It takes a minute to get the hang of how these controls work, but once I learned, I appreciated just how specific I could be. I would say, in general, too, that this unit's controls are a step up from my old unit's.. Now, no unit like this is perfect, I don't think. I do have a couple minor beefs with this one:. * Trays are completely separate. This one is hard to describe, but basically, the drip tray and the basket or rack all sit on separate levels. My old unit had a tray like this one does, but the basket sat directly on top of it. This made it easier to pull out, and it made much less mess. Now, if I want to pull out, say, a tray of french fries to rotate them, I also have to have a plate waiting on the counter to set it on, otherwise my counter gets all greasy. And if I'm cooking a burger and I want to flip it? Forget about it. Unless I use two hands to pull both the rack and the tray out at the same time and same speed, burger juice is going to end up dripping down on the bottom of the unit.. * Not a fan of the cool-down phase. When I turn it off, I'd rather it just turned off. I've got a busy house with a LOT of noise. Air fryers are great but they're always loud. When I'm done with it, I'm also done with the noise it makes. Only, in this case, I'm not because it keeps running.. * Runs REALLY hot on the air fryer mode. I appreciate the customizable controls that let you zero in on what temp you want, but that doesn't do much good when the unit runs much hotter than the temp suggests. Some of this, I'm willing to just chalk up to differences between my old unit and this one. But initially, I burned stuff with this because I set it to the recommended temp. Now, I don't usually use anything over 385 degrees. (Our fries and dino nugs, for example, say to cook at 425 degrees. Nope. Charred beyond recognition.) Just a quirk, I guess, but something to be aware of. It's also worth noting that I did NOT have any temp issues while using this on the oven setting. So if you're making something that's really temp sensitive (like Shrinky Dinks!), it may be a good idea to switch it to oven mode.. Despite some minor quibbles, I'm still really happy with this unit. It looks and functions great, with the caveats noted. I recommend this, especially if you're looking for a smaller model because of space constraints.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Kalorik-Toaster-AFO-47797-SS/dp/B09BK37SCT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Kalorik MAXX® 16 Quart Digital Air Fryer Oven, 9-in-1 Versatility, Bake, Braise, Broil, Dehydrate, Grill, Roast, Sear, Toast, 21 Presets, 5 Accessories, Bonus Cookbook, 500°F, 1600W, Stainless Steel"
" June 6, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,justcruzn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is replacing a 10 quart other brand completely that was recalled, so I’m comparing it to that and I really loved it. What is nice about this 16 quart is it is not bigger! I mean the inside is, but the unit isn’t big and bulky. If anything, it’s a bit smaller. Same width and depth, but a bit smaller! THAT is nice. Inside on the other hand is more room! I may not be great at math, but 10 to 16? Sounds like 60% more room to me! Now that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a good thing. In reality, I’m probably 15 to 20% more room because the side to side and front to back is what is important. I learned that you can’t just fill the machine up and have a multi course meal ready in no time. Anything on the top will block the fanned heat from the bottom. Which is why I like this over basket types. You are forced to layer your food a bit with this where the kids would try and load up the basket with tater tots and it was fail after fail. If you use the unit properly, you get some excellent results! This offers so much more than my last with up to 500 degrees and a cookie sheet for some baking! I can imagine this being PERFECT for collage kids and hotel rooms and other places where a full size oven isn’t practical!. The only bad side I seen to this is if you have kids, you may be very cautious of this. I like to pull it toward the edge of the counter to keep the heat from building up under the cupboard and push it back when I’m done. I didn’t get burned, but it was VERY warm compared to the last one I use to do this with. Hot even, but not so bad I got burned. My guess is the small footprint they were going for left them unable to put a bunch of unnecessary space between interior wall and exterior to keep the heat away from the outside. I still like this unit better because even the fan blades are stainless steel! The burner is mounted good and solid! I learned with my last one that if you put the tray closer to the burner, the food will cook a little faster and get a bit more crisp. I like how this one doesn’t have a slot for the tray/rack/sheet that puts it too close to the burner to cause concern. I did notice this allowed more heat to escape around the edges of the door when closed. They could have improved on insulation around the door or improving the seal when closed. They did put a nice system in the door to keep it from falling out of your hand and smashing against the counter beneath. It slows down near 75% opening like shock absorbers were installed or something.. Great machine, great build and once you figure it out it is easy to use. You need to select your desired method first. Mine is usually air fry. I doubt I’ll ever use defrost, but I will certainly use the oven one later! If you want more control over the temp and the time, you will need to press the big dial. It also functions as a button. Press it once to change the temp and press it again to change the time and you have complete control over it. I can now take my time with learning the presets and determine if they are worthy. The last button is for light and it is a nice light! The handle for the accessories was a bit interesting to learn how to use too. Use the one side to pull the tray out a bit and turn it over to grab it and remove from the machine. A pot holder is quicker and easier. They probably should improve the handle to include a quick grab and release button. It is a fantastic unit that offers so much!",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Kalorik-Toaster-AFO-47797-SS/dp/B09BK37SCT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Kalorik MAXX® 16 Quart Digital Air Fryer Oven, 9-in-1 Versatility, Bake, Braise, Broil, Dehydrate, Grill, Roast, Sear, Toast, 21 Presets, 5 Accessories, Bonus Cookbook, 500°F, 1600W, Stainless Steel"

" April 8, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this to replace another brand of air fryer/toaster oven that died after 9 months. So far, after 4 days, this oven is working as expected. I did have to make adjustments to the time and temperature when making toast, and I lower the temp when air frying. Using the oven for various tasks is very easy and pretty much intuitive.. So far, I’ve made toast, lamb chops, chicken wings, chicken parm, meatloaf with baked potatoes, and roasted veggies. The longest the oven has run is 45 minutes at 350, then 10 mins at 425 and none of the outside surfaces got too extremely hot.. When on Air Fry, this oven is a bit noisier than my other oven. It’s not bad, but you can definitely tell it’s on. The oven doesn’t get overly hot when it’s working, but I have it set on a heat-resistant counter protecter and I have another protecter placed behind the oven to protect the wall. I also wrapped the wire in several layers of aluminum foil to protect it from any heat from the back.. It’s easy to clean the inside. I wipe it down with a mix of water, white vinegar, and a little bit of Dawn dishwashing soap. I wash the air fry basket and oven rack by hand, and I covered the baking pan with foil to protect it and make clean up easier.. My only complaints (and these are not really complaints, more like mild annoyances) are that 1) the crumb tray is just slightly wider than a regular size piece of aluminum foil, so if you want to completely line the tray, you need two pieces of foil. And, 2) the rack has a tendency to pitch forward if you pull it too far out of the oven, so you need to be mindful of that when checking food temps, etc., while cooking.. So…so far, so good. I did purchase the optional warranty, just in case this one dies after a while. Thankfully, I had that on the other oven. Fingers crossed I won’t need it on this one.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Oster-RapidCrisp-12-Function-Countertop-Convection/dp/B08CNMX519/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Oster Digital Air Fryer Oven with RapidCrisp, Stainless Steel, 12-Function Countertop Oven with Convection,Silver"

" October 26, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,JD,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Looks good, seems to work okay so far.. Those who say the toast function doesn't work, keep reading.. I purchased this specifically to fit in my 15"" wide x 14"" tall appliance garage, It sticks out a bit too far to close the garage door, but I plan to use it daily. Hopefully the heat does not discolor the cabinets over time. It does not seem to get super hot on the exterior when in use, but I have not ran it more than 15 minutes at a time so far. Thankfully it doesn't have a super dorky weird-sounding brand name like so many Amazon products, since it is on display in my kitchen.. I am happy that it seems to have all mechanical controls, meaning no circuit boards to randomly stop working. I peeked through the vent slots in the back, and no circuit boards could be seen.. It has 2 mechanical timers, one timer for the oven/air fry functions and one timer for the toaster function.. The construction quality seems decent, stainless finish doesn't have any dents, door opens smoothly, knobs feel smooth and sturdy, seems to heat up fairly quickly. Interior light is manually operated with a button, and light it is bright. I am concerned the bulb will burn out like so many other reviews mention, but right now it seems to work fine. There is no instructions on bulb replacement in the manual.. To the reviewers who say the toast function does not work, try this: the toast function on my brand new unit didn't function until I noticed that the temperature knob must be turned fully clockwise to 450 deg F for TOAST/BROIL. It has a mark on the temperature dial at 450 Deg F for ""TOAST/BROIL"", but it is easily overlooked.. To use Toast:. Set mode knob to TOAST (5 o'clock on the mode knob).. Set temperature to max 450 Deg F TOAST (3 o'clock on the temperature knob).. Set the right timer knob TOAST TIMER to the desired time ( light, med, dark, or 10 minutes max).. Toaster works fine for me if I do the above steps..

I was fairly certain I was looking for a combo model air fryer, since my old (non air frying) toaster oven was clearly on its way out, and I wanted a device that could do both types of cooking, since I used my old toaster oven a lot (I don't usually cook enough to warrant heating up my big, full-size oven). This Cosori 12-in-1 model had been recommended as a lower cost alternative to the highly rated Breville model... similar features, maybe not as highly reviewed, but literally half the price. About 3 months ago, I randomly logged onto Amazon, and happened to click on this product, as it was shown as a ""recently viewed item"", and saw that for a period of just a couple days, there was both a manufacturer and a vendor coupon available simultaneously, which made this product available for a particularly low price, even cheaper than some clearly inferior lower-end models... so I finally pulled the trigger.. Everything arrived on time, and in good working order. I set it up and tested it, and ""bake"", ""toast"", and ""air fry"" all seemed to work. I don't know much about the other 9 functions, and don't anticipate using them much, so limited my initial testing to those 3. I was initially skeptical about getting a model with digital controls, because I appreciated the simplicity of the manual controls on my previous toaster ovens... but these controls were very straightforward and intuitive... no need to consult the manual or online resources at all.. So, after I first set it up, I didn't actually use it for a few days. The reason being, before I started cooking in it, I first ordered a large silicone mat to place on the counter below it. I did this because every toaster oven I've previously owned always wound up with crumbs and gunk underneath, periodically requiring an extra hard round of counter cleansing. I figured placing this mat underneath should make that much easier. I then wrapped the removable floor panel of the Cosori oven in aluminum foil, which should also make that much easier to clean. I also ordered another, smaller, silicone mat, and placed that on top of the foil-covered floor of the oven. I made sure the mat is heat resistant to above the max temp of the oven, of course.. In the 3 months I've been using it, I haven't had to replace the foil covering the floor of the oven so far, and I simply rinse off the silicone mat that sits inside the oven every week or so. Since it's flexible, it's very easy to do. Some reviews here mention that it's very difficult to clean the rest of the inside of the oven. I haven't encountered that myself, but I simply might not be making the kinds of things that make such cleaning necessary. So far I've sprayed and wiped off the inside of the front glass door maybe once a month, and the inside walls have not required any cleaning thus far.. As for the functionality, I've found that it does everything my old toaster oven did, plus (obviously) more. Some professional reviewers like Consumer Reports or Good Housekeeping or CNET test a bunch of models with the exact same foods, and compare results. One of the things they do is fill the oven up pretty heavily, then test for things like uniformity of cooking. Where they might, for example, toast 9 slices of bread simultaneously (since a lot of these devices advertise that capacity), and see how evenly they toast... often finding that the ones in the corner didn't cook as evenly, etc. Well, I'll tell you right now, I'm a single guy, and rarely need 9 slices of toast... but when I try to toast 2 slices, centered in the middle of the oven, they come out perfectly. Same goes for making a frozen pizza. Or air frying 6 chicken wings, which I do often. Or making a standard size tray of brownies, which I've done once. Or heating up a couple hot dogs (I prefer heating them in a toaster oven as opposed to boiling or microwaving). I haven't tried stuff like baking a whole cake, or making a whole rotisserie chicken (even though it came with the accessories to do so), since, again, as a single guy, there's not much reason for me to do either, and the price of a store-bought cake or rotisserie chicken is low enough that I'm not really going to bother.. Also, since this is the first air fryer I've ever owned, one of the things I wanted to check is that there was really a difference between baking and air frying. Obviously I can see and hear the fan turn on when in air fry mode, which is the major differentiator (though unlike what some have said, I find the fan very quiet... I can only hear it if I'm right next to the unit, not even from the other side of the kitchen). So, I tried bake vs air fry when making wings (since I make them often), and I can say that there is absolutely a difference, and they're noticeably crisper when air frying. Some have said that toaster oven / air fryer combo models don't make food as crisp as typical cylindrical air fryers that have a frying basket with a handle. Well, I can't comment on that, since I've never owned one of those. Also, I know that french fry crispness is a major factor for some people, and understandably so. However, I haven't tried making fries from scratch, so I also can't comment there. But, I've found this device to do a very good job both with bagged frozen fries, as well as with reheating fries from a restaurant. I just spray some cooking spray on them... I don't actually add any oil beyond that.. Anyway, I hope this review was informative, while also understanding that it will probably be more useful to other single people like me who are not cooking very large quantities at once. One more thing I found as well... a couple reviews here mentioned that once you initiate a cycle, it starts preheating, then beeps once it's preheated, then you have to go back and press the start button again to start the actual cook cycle. I'm not sure why people think this is strange. After all, the whole purpose of preheating is to get the oven to the proper temperature before putting in the food... so of course you have to come back and put the food in, and then press the start button again to start the cook cycle. That being said however, I don't fancy myself some kind of professional chef, and I don't want to bother waiting for it to preheat and then walk back and put the food in. Ok, sure, on the very rare occasions I'm making something in my huge, full-size kitchen oven, I'll do it. But when I'm just heating up something small, in a smaller appliance like this Cosori 12-in-1 oven, I just throw it in, add somewhere between 3 or 4 minutes to the cook time to make up for the lack of preheating, then skip the preheating function altogether... which can be done very easily, by simply hitting the start button a second time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Convection-Dehydrator-Rotisserie-Accessories/dp/B07W67NQMN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Cosori Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, 12-in-1 Convection Oven with Rotisserie, Christmas Gifts, Stainless Steel 32QT, 6 Slice Toast, 13'' Pizza,100 Recipes (6 Accessories Included), CO130-AO"
" February 26, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,Kdb,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a fan of air fryers for a while now and this is my second one. The first one I had was the basket design and I loved it but wanted something bigger. To properly cook food in an air fryer, you need to have things spread out enough that the hot air can get completely around everything, kind of like hot oil. So, the photos you see of people filling up their basket fryers completely with fries is not really a good idea if you want everything to cook evenly. Also, for something that takes up precious counter space in my small kitchen, I wanted it to have additional uses. By getting this one, I was able to get rid of my toaster oven, which I use quite often. And this one can cook more than one piece of toast at a time so that was a bonus.. The main purpose, however, is still the air fryer and while this works well, there are some drawbacks. I think the larger size makes it less efficient and therefore things don't seem to be getting as crispy as they did in my old air fryer. I do a lot of roasted veggies (carrots, potatoes, broccoli) and it takes longer to get them to the nice roasted level (a bit of charring around the edges). Same with chicken. Again, I think the overall size slows it down so one of the pros about this unit is also one of the cons. The big con with air frying is that this unit takes forever to preheat. As an example, I like to air fry broccoli. Toss it with some olive oil and spices and in my old air fryer, it was crispy and perfect in about 7 minutes (at 380-400 degrees). However, it takes that long for this air fryer to even heat up and I've noticed that things do cook best if you wait until it reaches the higher temps to put them in (foods with oil on them need to be cooked at high temps if you want them to get crispy and not just oily). So, now I wait 7-10 minute for it to heat up, and then the broccoli takes at least 10 minutes to cook at 400 degrees. So, it takes about three times as long to make it compared to my old air fryer. Not a huge deal overall, but disappointing and unexpected. If time is a big issue for you, this unit is less efficient than the basket fryers.. Another thing I actually loved making in my old fryer was steak. About 4-6 minutes and it cooked a decent medium to medium-well steak and would kind of char the outside a bit, which is what I wanted. This fryer will cook it fairly well, but I discovered it's good for cooking the inside and not so good for the outside. So, I cook the steak in the fryer to get it to the desired level of inside cooking and then quickly flash fry it in a cast iron pan that is already heated on high -- about 30 seconds on each side does it. Again, no big deal but more time.. On the other features, pretty much the same. I've tried baking items and it works well -- just takes longer to heat up. I've also recently used the pizza setting to heat up pizza and at least on that one you can just put the pizza in while it's preheating as it's pretty much done by the time it reaches the temp you set. And it does a good job -- certainly better than the microwave as it browns and crisps it instead of just heating it and making it soggy.. One nice thing this unit has that my basket unit didn't is different slots to put the pans to cook things differently. For example, to broil you put the pan in the very top slot so the food is closer to the heating element. And it's helpful that the different slots are labeled so you don't have to read or memorize the directions to know this.. Speaking of the controls, they are good and typically easy once you've used them a few times. I like that they are digital as things are much more precise than trying to figure out a manual wheel timer that never seems to be accurate. The timer on this is very good and it alerts you with beeping when the preheating is done and when the cooking timer is up. It's just a bit confusing that you have to again push start at that time or it won't actually start cooking. I get that this is so the timer starts at the right time, but it can be confusing the first few times you use it. The other thing is that it takes a while for the lights to go off once you have canceled cooking so I tend to unplug it when not in use. I do that with a lot of my appliances anyway so no big deal.. I haven't yet tried the dehydrating feature so I'll update my review as soon as I have because I'm excited for that one. I'll also try out a few of the other settings, but I've used the main ones enough to talk about them. Toast does what you'd expect, bagel seems to do what toast does just more heat on the top than the bottom, and I'm not sure what the difference is between bake and cookies because I didn't realize cookies needed their own setting (I think that one is kind of an add on to make it look cooler by having extra settings). I'll also try the rotisserie setting at some point because that one looks awesome but messy. Ferment is probably the only one I probably won't use.. As for the cleaning, well, that is definitely much more difficult than my basket air fryer. That one, I could easily take out the basket and soak the inside with hot water and some dish soap and then just rinse it clean after dinner. Or, pop both parts in the dishwasher. It was fairly quick and easy to clean and even if I forgot about it for a day or so, a quick soak got it clean. This one, however, is a bit more difficult as there are more parts. Granted, I knew this going in but didn't quite anticipate the cleaning time. To keep things easier, I quickly learned to cover the bottom drip pan in foil. Much easier than trying to clean it after each use. And I can keep the foil on for a while unless it gets really dirty from one use. The glass door actually cleans quite easily if you clean it right away before things dry and cook onto the glass. It seems to have a coating to help with this but I do recommend wiping it down after each use. I had read other reviews about stuff dripping down in between the glass door and the bottom drip pan so I just put a paper towel under the door if I'm cooking something particularly juicy. Then use the same towel to wipe down the glass and down in the space between the door and drip pan. If you clean that after each use, it doesn't get bad. The hard thing to keep clean in this air fryer is the air fry tray. It doesn't appear to have a non-stick surface so definitely spray it with some oil beforehand or you will have food cooked to it that won't soak off even after sitting in hot, soapy water for hours. I pretty much destroyed a scrubby sponge getting the burnt bits of whatever off it. Things get stuck in between the wires and stay there. The broiler pan, however, it easier to clean and appears to be nonstick.. And be aware that this unit gets really hot while you are cooking things so be careful about keeping anything on top of it or directly next to it. I basically have the directions and my silicone mitt and that's it. Toasty!. Lastly, on the noise this one is maybe a bit louder than my old air fryer but not noticeably so. It has to be loud because of the convection, but it's not loud enough to really be a bother and my living room is right next to my kitchen so I'm about 15 feet away while it's cooking. I certainly don't have to turn the TV up tons to hear over it. I think it helps to give it space between it and the wall and other appliances to keep the air flow clear and it seems less loud when it has proper space.. Overall, I'm happy with it because of the extra features. If it were being used only as an air fryer, I would probably go back to the basket style, but the extra uses in this unit make it worth the extra cooking time and clean up. The size is bigger but it replaced my toaster oven and old air fryer so I actually gained some space. I also don't need to keep a dehydrator or toaster so it makes up for it size with those uses as well. Most of the other features are also on my oven, but it's nice to not have to use the oven to cook smaller things. And in that sense, this could work well in a tiny house or other space where you don't have room for a full-size oven. And while I've only used it for a couple of months, it appears to be well made so I anticipate it lasting a good long time. Again, I'll update if that changes. I do keep the boxes for things like this until the warranty runs out, just in case.. If you are thinking about this one as compared to a basket fryer, I would consider whether you would use it for the other things it does. If so, then the cons for air frying make it worthwhile. If you are simply looking for a large unit then I think this one compares very well to the others that are similar. I have a friend who has the Cuisinart one and this does everything theirs does and more, for less money. I also like that this one had a decent warranty as opposed to my old one (Emeril brand -- not good.).. If there is anything you'd like to know about this air fryer, feel free to ask and I'll respond as quickly as possible.

" October 27, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"REVIEW UPDATED BELOW: I Read the reviews and ordered this. I LOVE the taste of the food cooked inside of this. But just let me tell you- cleaning this thing is a LABOR of LOVE! I made bacon, burgers, zucchini, and string beans inside of this tonight, and by the end of my cooking, the entire house was filled with grease smoke. The grease coming off the bacon and burgers splashed all over the inside of this oven. Clean up took me an hour afterwards. Including trying to scrub the pans afterwards. I have found that grease splatters and drips into crevices attached to the door handle- and I have to sit there with a sharp thin knife, and paper towel, and stick the sharp edge of the knife into the crevices with the paper towel trying to get the grease that has dripped into the crevice of the door. But the food was so good. Then I found that two parts of the interior paint flaked off already- so that’s not good. I’m going to contact customer service and see what they say. I really do love this thing as it makes food taste awesome. But our house smells like a fast food burger joint from making dinner, and it’s SO messy to use. When cooking the grease gets everywhere! All angles of toaster oven. So you will have to clean clean clean each and every single time you use it. Otherwise you’ll end up with rancid oil smells and oil stains. We have 3 ozone machines and turned them on- but I still smell grease in here. It’s almost like using a grill inside- I almost think I should use this thing out on the patio when using air fry mode. And to clarify, the air fryer mode which is what we primarily have been using is what makes the oil splash everywhere. And the other 3 star reviewer’s are absolutely right in what they said, when you pull the mesh air fryer pan out oil does get everywhere. It drips on the door and gets in the cracks. I’m a bit disappointed. I’m also wondering what the material of the toaster is made out of. I’m thinking if the temperature is getting his hot, and it’s not stainless steel, that probably isn’t optimal. But the fact that the interior coating flaked already means This one will have to go back. I do love Cosori I think they make nice things at an affordable price and their customer service is great. We shall see. I am going to call them tomorrow. Will update my review soon.. *UPDATE! They got back to me via email but wanted videos and I just didn’t have the energy or time to accomodate. I was within my 30 days so this was returned back to Amazon. Packed this up and ordered the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer instead. Tried that out- better toaster with some nice features making it easier to clean but same issues— after a few weeks inside of toaster was trashed! Rancid oil everywhere with no way to clean. Then I moved on to GoWiseUSA 7 quart air fryer, the type with a basket And OMG! I am absolutely in love with this air fryer. I also realize the issues I had with the previous ones-. A smart oven air fryer is not an air fryer in ANY WAY!! It simply has an air fryer feature!! But the downside is it makes a mess inside of the oven with no way to fully clean it. After getting a 7 quart air fryer with a basket, I can see that this thing blows both toasters out of the water! It is SUPER fast and powerful and makes super CRISPY food, and it is super simple and easy to clean! I absolutely love it. I make kale chips almost every day and am loving it! The other thing with the air fryer oven is it didn’t get anything crispy like in the pictures. The air fryer basket I now have is absolutely amazing and makes the crispiest food ever. I made some roasted chicken wings and turkey thighs that tasted like they were from KFC but better. I don’t eat fast food currently but of course as I child I did.

If you are not air frying in the Cosori smart air fryer oven I am sure it will work great to make baked items etc. After going through all of this and experiencing everything, I will reiterate one more time what I have learned— there’s just NO way somebody can spray items with oil and air fry in any kind of smart air fryer oven regardless of the brand. It’s a nice concept. But there is absolutely no way to clean it. That being said, I am starting to feel like all of the air fryers with baskets are the way to go.

It’s a nice concept. But there is absolutely no way to clean it. That being said, I am starting to feel like all of the air fryers with baskets are the way to go. I know that Cosori makes an air fryer basket model- I would definitely recommend basket over oven. And I do normally LOVE Cosori, this concept just is not a good one in reality. The only reason I didn’t order the basket to begin with is because they have a nonstick coating, but after using it I don’t feel that it affects the food anyway. The food is just gently sitting in the basket, and the heat and the air is cooking it. Also clean up is a breeze, with the basket you just take it out and soak it in the sink and wipe it clean, dry and put it away. I also don’t see any oil splattered up inside of my unit. The fan is so powerful I believe it keeps oil at bay. So it cooks beautifully and is super easy to maintain. So once again, as a final note, I do not recommend Cosori Air fryer oven for air frying, I do recommend using basket models for air frying, I have the 7 Quart GowiseUSA and it is awesome. Perfect size! I cannot speak from experience but Cosori may certainly have an excellent basket model.

Bake chicken in it and it’s super juicy and way faster than my regular oven. Saves on electricity and with the convection feature everything cooks faster than what the cooking instructions state.. Only thing I don’t like is the display lights up when the oven is touched. And the display stays on for 30 min- even after the oven is turned off. This makes is super confusing seeing the display lit up and questioning whether I turned the toaster oven off or not.. Another draw back is the metal the oven is made out of is thin. So when the oven heats up- I can hear the oven making a “banging” noise because the metal is expanding. When it cools down, another banging noise when the metal constricts. I don’t think the unit will fall apart - but I expect the metal to be sturdy enough to make these noises..

" November 4, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,techteachok,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Original Review: Like all the features and flexibility, BUT.... After the factory breakin- fryer basket level and even. After 1st use for 10 minutes at 375 aiy frying brussel sprouts - underside of basket looks like someone tried to throw a basket ball through it - SPRUNG upwards bad.. Update 11.4.2019:. Contacted Customer Support - what pleasant folks to deal with - new air fry mesh pan on the way. Have a new problem - when the heating elements are heating up to 400 degrees (mostly what I am air frying at) it's quiet as a mouse with a slight whisper of the convection fan moving air. BUT, when it has ""heated"" and begins to cool down there is a loud thunk, thunk, thunk, - somehow some metal or combination of metals in the heating elements and/or the interior oven walls are cooling and making loud noises. As soon as the heating cycle starts again it is quiet as a mouse again.. Update 11.18.2019:. Wow Customer Service wanted to investigate the old unit, so they replaced it instead of just sending the basket - said their engineers want to see the problem. New replacement is great - no basket issues, no sounds - quite as a whisper/fan can be. Failed the mention the recipes and guides are well written, good details on the unit, and couldn't find any ""English as a second language"" problems you are used to seeing on things made in China. Just wished there were MORE recipes than they supplied. (I don't facebook or tweet so unless those blogs/info/hints/tips are on the web site I have nothing more than what is written/supplied with the unit).. I think this is a great value for all the functions you get, since there is nothing with all these features in this under $200 price range - BUT there are a couple of things I hope the address in a future upgrade.. 1. Unless I am just not doing it right, the rotisserie is difficult to put in - tolerances are to close and not enough angle to easily put in -- and almost impossible to get out with their oversized coat hanger/handle - again you have to turn at an angle and be able to slide it out of the motor side and the tolerances are so close when you hit the right side of the over it falls off the hanger/handle. The indentation where the rods goes into the clip (or the clip) needs to allow you to move the rotisserie to the right to clear the motor spindle on the left and then be able to raise it up and out. Not a showstopper just use heavy duty BBQ rubber gloves and take in out by hand where I can control all the bumping and grinding it takes to get the rotisserie out. Hope the engineers get this done in version 2.. 2. The inside door hinge on the left and right side are not sealed/covered so that garlic, parmesan. grease drips into it and is almost impossible to get out. Another 1 1/2 inches of extending the inside stainless strip on each side would have solved that problem. Can we say not a showstopper but would be nice to engineer that in version 2. Even though they tell you to NOT put anything on the door when it is down - my solution is to take a 9 x 13 aluminum bake pan and place it on the door and then pull the tray out using the pan to catch everything that drips - then grab both the pan and the tray together and transport both to the counter. Clean door, no drips, clean floor, clean counter - works for me.. 3. Again not a showstopper, moisture/grease accumulates on the door and drips down and then out on the counter because of the design of the bottom lip of the unit. I think that design should be changed so that it drips inside the oven instead of outside the oven. My solution is to take a piece of aluminum foil and place it under the entire length of the door to catch the drips. If they don't make any changes to the bottom of the unit, then there really needs to be an outside drip tray that can be put underneath (kind of like the old George Forman Grills).. 4. There is an inconvenience factor in cleaning the grease, water from in-between the bottom lip of the unit and the bottom of the door-- takes time to fold a paper towel and slide it back and forth to absorb the accumulated drops (until the towel comes out clean). Again not a showstopper but hopefully would be corrected in a version 2.. None of the above grumblings would stop me from purchasing the unit again, because I like it that much. I would have given the unit 4 stars - but the outstanding customer support and willingness to do whatever is right for the customer - not matter what - demands a 5 star review.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Convection-Dehydrator-Rotisserie-Accessories/dp/B07W67NQMN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Cosori Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, 12-in-1 Convection Oven with Rotisserie, Christmas Gifts, Stainless Steel 32QT, 6 Slice Toast, 13'' Pizza,100 Recipes (6 Accessories Included), CO130-AO"

" November 14, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Jill M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My goals in this purchase were to have a smaller oven that didn't take as long to preheat as my 30"" Dacor gas range oven and that hopefully was less energy. Dacor has a rock solid oven temp buuatttt is a 45-60 min preheat. It has convection.. There in a bunch of good here - so I'll be keeping it. For me, the primary bad is how hot the exterior of the oven gets - everywhere. It is NOT FOR A HOME WITH CHILDREN. At the upper temps, the outer stainless skin will literally burn you.. Other than that -- it's light - my old lady self can easily move it outside in good weather or to a porch in mediocre weather. Which means that I can bake in the summer without concern about heating up the house with it's little volcano self, but I can reap the benefits of also heating up the house in cooler times.. It's fast. Preheat for Pizza at 375 f was 5 minutes. Turned on convection with frozen pizza and pizza was done 4-5 minutes faster than the box directions. It was done ""better"" than same pizza, same settings in the Dacor oven - more even browning and cheese melting.. The only really suckie long preheat I've seen is for broil - which is darned near instant in a gas oven. Broil also didn't turn out so well. Again, that could be settings or where they tell you to put the tray (way up close) when they only have two heat bars and those are positioned towards front and back. You can't see what is happening during the broil. Be happy to read advice about that.. Bake preheats quickly and does well with convection - heating all the rack positions. I think I'm going to buy extra racks and mini sheet pans. It fits 1/4 sheet steam table pans just swell on the rack. I also have 1/4 bun pans which are also fine. Again, it seems to go faster than the Dacor oven. I'm still adjusting.. The light is great. It reflects throughout the unit because of the somewhat shiney interior. I foiled the crumb tray to death, so hopefully I'll never have the joy of cleaning it free of burned on crud.. The door could use some work. The single door hinge is kinda cheezy ball. It would be nice if the door got entirely out of the way, or if the door had enough support to put a transfer plater or cutting board on it.. I have not yet tried dehydrate, proof or ferment. I'm looking forward to them. Or the rotisserie, but I thank the people who posted about it's weight limitations and general messiness.. Keep warm will be very helpful - it seems to work ok. I'm enjoying being able to dial the time/temp up and down after picking a general setting.. I didn't have any faith in ""Toast"", and that proves correct, but I'll give it more tests before I give up on it.. I have never owned an air fryer, so I don't have any experience to compare. ""Air fry"" I tried and it worked as well as my faking ""air fry"" in the Dacor (convection, lotta cooling racks to lift food over a bun pan). Which is like ""Bake, now with less oil!"". For me, this is a good 2nd oven.

" May 3, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,Mathew T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After purchasing the COSORI 12-in-1 Air Fryer Toaster Oven as a gift for my wife at Christmas, I have to say: I was worried. Not only if this thing would work as advertised (I did my research), but would she even like it? It stayed in the box for about a month but I kept my mouth shut. I've bought stuff before that she didn't like. They usually didn't stick around long. Concerns continued to mount but I remained silent. Finally she tried using it. She obviously wasn't a fan of the gift as evidenced of our old school toaster oven remaining prominently in an improved location. Yet another sign this wasn't going to go well. Seen this before. Fingers remained crossed. Sure enough, it finally got its day in court and I am happy to say that I have been exonerated! She loves it and uses the bad boy all the time. She has never looked back. That was close. Some specifics on why it's been such at hit for us:. Air frying - works great. Exceptional for Japanese tonkatsu, chicken katsu, things like that. I love putting in tater tots, french fries and don't forget the bacon. The bacon comes out absolutely perfect. The light helps you fine tune the finish to your particular taste. We have touchy stomachs in our family. We are now able to enjoy fried food without the drawback of oil. This is great.. Toaster oven - seems over powered for the job, especially when used for only one person (I'm the only one in our family who eats breakfast). That said - I haven't had toast this good in a very long time. I know that sounds silly. I thought the toast would come out burnt and dry but it seemed really good at keeping the outside toasted without dehydrating the inside. Love it.. Rotisserie - no clue. I have a showtime rotisserie and I'll be honest: I have no plans to replace it. I'll probably try this sometime. Maybe. I doubt it.. Internal light - I really like that thing. Its bright. I can use it whenever I want. I comes on a minute before timer goes off. Almost like a reminder. It comes in handy.. Cookbook - meh. Could use more stuff in it, but seriously, that's not why I bought it. I think I looked at it once.. Oven/Baking - It bakes well. My 2 daughters have started to use it all the time. They love it. I benefit from that. Win-Win.. Other functions? Not sure yet. Still exploring the possibilities. I will say that I personally like the oven and the different cooking modes that come with it. I'll pick versatility over utility every time. Luckily this hasn't been a factor for us. This oven excels at both.. Cleaning - we really haven't had an issue. We keep it clean after use and it hasn't been a problem. When we cook greasy things we use a drip tray. We line that with foil making clean up afterwards simple. Not much to clean if you think ahead.. Crumb tray - Not really sure about that thing. It seems too shallow but we keep it clean so it hasn't been a factor. When we cook something we know will get messy, we use a drip tray.. One drawback - Accessories: This thing needs to come with another fry basket as default. One doesn't cut it. Especially when cooking for a family of 5. I haven't looked outside amazon, but doesn't seem to be easy to purchase accessories.. Be careful putting in the wire shelf. If it goes in backwards and you don't catch it - beware. You're glass door will slam into it when it shuts. Not sure if anyone has had issues with breakage, but it's something to keep an eye on.. Overall, excellent purchase. 5 stars. This IS our oven and it's the only one we use now. The wife loves it. The family loves it. Enough said.

" August 20, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,AbiGezunt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's an old maxim about 'jack of all trades, master of none' which made me a little hesitant about this purchase. Turns out this oven really is terrific. It's taking the place of a very old Cuisinart toaster oven that could handle about 4 pieces of toast, maybe 3 baking potatoes. This oven does have a slightly larger footprint and is taller, but it does so much, still fits under cabinets, and so far, everything has been to our liking. From chicken wings, to cod schnitzel, toast, blueberry - applesauce muffins, mini-challah breads, roasted veggies, meatballs, to about a 5-pound rotisserie chicken. That last item needed a little extra kitchen cooking twine, and even then a leg fell out. But the spit kept turning and the chicken was moist and skin had a lovely texture. Not gonna lie, cleaning after rotisserie chicken was a bit of a pain, but so worth it. Using foil on the bottom/under heating elements helped, and an old toothbrush was needed to clean up in the crevasse under the glass door. But that was to be expected for rotisserie.. Pros: every thing i've cooked comes out moister than my full size oven, cooks faster. Manual easy to understand. Oven has preset time/temperature setting for each function, but manual shows how to easily change both. Using meat thermometer i find everything cooks way faster, so meals are ready more quickly. Internal oven light allows you to keep an eye on everthing. Even fits 12-muffin tin and 1/8 sheet pan or casserole (13"" x 10"").. Minor Cons (at least for us, your mileage may vary) : Does take up a little more space than toaster oven, but not by that much. The rotisserie does a great job, but this is NOT a self cleaning oven. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. We wish we could permanently lower its built in settings for toast, bagels, but since it can be adjusted, really not much of a con.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Convection-Dehydrator-Rotisserie-Accessories/dp/B07W67NQMN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Cosori Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo, 12-in-1 Convection Oven with Rotisserie, Christmas Gifts, Stainless Steel 32QT, 6 Slice Toast, 13'' Pizza,100 Recipes (6 Accessories Included), CO130-AO"

" February 12, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Pappy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I unboxed it and everything that was supposed to be included was included. I had a bad experience with one that I returned.. I began by making toast. It is not easy to ruin toast. Well, it came out almost perfectly [The bread was refrigerated - my error]. I will adjust the wire rack next time to a higher level and reduce the time from 6 minutes to 5 minutes. So far 5 stars out of 5.. Next, I grilled a frozen, pre-cooked sausage patty. I pre-heated the oven, but reduced the time to 6 minutes. I put the patty on the grill tray and put it on the lowest level, using the ""steak"" setting for 4 minutes. It came out perfectly. Again, 5 stars out of 5.. NOTE: I did add a sheet of aluminum foil [shiny side down] on the drip tray to keep it as clean as possible. No effect on time, temperature or result. There was no information about using aluminum foil in the instructions, so I felt that it would be OK.. Then I used the ""air fry"" setting. I put 8 frozen chicken nuggets in the wire basket, set the oven for ""wings"" [the nuggets are small like wings], set the pre-heat to 5 minutes and set the time to 10 minutes. Pre-heat went off and I put the wire basket on the second level from the bottom and anxiously waited for the 10 minute timer to finish. Not to my amazement, they also came out perfectly. I added some hot sauce for flavor. Once again, 5 stars out of 5.. NOTE: These were not home made. Over the weekend when I have more time, I will make chicken nuggets from scratch.. Pros: Easy to use. Easy to clean. The only 2 knobs [Temperature and Time] are well lit from the back, easy to see and easy to turn. The food comes out perfectly cooked. It is very easy to adjust the Temperature and/or Time. The instructions are clear with black and white drawings.. Con: As hard as I tried, I was not able to teach the oven to walk my dog or fill out my tax returns and I am not able to give it 10 stars.. This is a BIG WINNER. Buy one. You will not be sorry..

" February 28, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Chantel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this to replace my broken toaster oven and I've been waiting a few weeks to write the review, specifically, before I tried out a few of the recipes in the book that comes with the air fryer. Because of that, I had thought that there was something wrong with the appliance because nothing was coming out right. So far, I have attempted to make the Apple Crisps, Mozarella Sticks, Banana Bread, Sweet Potato Fries and the German Pancakes.. All of them came out WRONG.. The German Pancakes were underbaked (liquid in the middle). The Apple Crisps were soggy. Mozarella Sticks were stodgy. Sweet Potato Fries, limp and the Banana Bread was undercooked in the middle. Luckily, I have some experience when it comes to baking, so my second time around, attempting some the same recipes, I made adjustments. My sweet potato fries are delicious and my husband finished my banana nut loaf in two days. Needless to say, do not rely on the recipe book (I am sure a lot of information was hurried/omitted to keep it looking attractive) but take the time to visit other cooking website or rely on your own cooking knowledge. For example, I don't think there is any appliance in the world that can cook a loaf of banana bread in 30 minutes at a low temp.. When cooking other things, such as tator-tots, veggie chicken nuggets, corn dogs, etc. the air fryer works extremely well! You can keep using the same temperature you would usually when cooking things like these, simply take it out of the air fryer a few minutes earlier.. For that, I lowered the stars in the ""Easy to Use"" category because you, most of the time, have to watch your food until you learn/memorize what settings, cooking temps and cooking times to adjust.

" October 28, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third air-fryer I've purchased. The first was very similar to this one, but it made everything smell like burnt plastic and taste just as bad. I had it for months and it never improved, so I returned it to the manufacturer. The second was a toaster oven with an air-fry basket. Food smelled and tasted better in it, but it was impossible to clean. The basket and the drip tray under it rusted right away. I could never get all of it off the tray, whether I put it in the dishwasher or scrubbed it by hand. I did better with the basket, but eventually it started to rust, too, and I couldn't get it off. So, I ended up throwing the oven out.. This one smelled bad, too. And the smell didn't go away quickly, as the manufacturer and several reviews claimed. I ran the initial cleaning proceedure for a couple of weeks before it finally went away -- and didn't try to cook anything in it before then. I wrote to the manufacturer, but never got an answer. But then, I was finally able to use it. I was able to fit more food in this one than I expected (more than my previous fryer and the toaster oven, too -- which surprised me). It was much easier to clean than expect. Very simple. The basket and tray go right into the dishwasher. I was impressed with that.. It comes with a big transparent sticker with a ""Settings Guide"", which I found helpful. But, insead of painting it on the unit, or at least sticking the sticker on for you, this company expects you to apply it yourself. I wasn't able to do it correctly. I kept getting air bubbles in it and it started to curl the first time I tried to peel it off and reapply it. It looks terrible an makes an otherwise attractive appliance look cheap and shoddy. I'm going to peel it off permanently as soon as I have memorized the settings.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/COSORI-Space-saving-Low-noise-Dishwasher-Reference/dp/B0BDFSD7F9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"COSORI Small Air Fryer Oven 2.1 Qt, 4-in-1 Mini Airfryer, Bake, Roast, Reheat, Space-saving & Low-noise, Nonstick and Dishwasher Safe Basket, 97% less oil, Sticker with 6 Reference Guides, Red"

" February 13, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Amy K.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Original review: I've had my Nuwave Bravo XL for a few days and I wish I could give it a glowing review, but after less than stellar results I can't. I think that over time, I will learn to work around its quirks. My version came with a number of accessories including a silicone mat and a mesh tray/rack but not an air fryer basket (I can use the mesh rack, though it's not as deep).. The first head scratch moment was trying to assemble the racks in it since what I got didn't match the instructions. I'll figure out how best the racks and trays fit and ignore the manual. Note: the manual is easier to follow once you've used the Bravo a few times because you'll be more familiar with the knob and buttons.. Tried to make toast, burnt the first and undercooked the second. I make my own bread, so will have to experiment with what will actually work, homemade bread seems to toast differently than store bought.. Major issue with the warming function. I wanted to proof my pizza dough and chose the warming function. When chosen, it is supposed to default to 140 degrees for 1 hour. You can easily adjust temperature up or down. I readjusted it to 80 degrees. I followed the instructions. You can see the result in the picture (fortunately my husband noticed before we had a real disaster and only lost the container). When I checked the unit it was set to 350. I thought I had messed up, but have since tried this function, manual in hand and find that it ultimately defaults to 350 for 15 minutes. (I learned from customer service that the warm function kicks in after you've performed another function, i.e. bake at 350 for 15 minutes).. So does it cook? Absolutely, but be very watchful until you really figure it out.. Update 2/17/23: Company contacted me directly and provided guidance and acknowledged that the manual is not very clear and will look to adjust it in the future. 5 stars for customer service!",4.0 out of 5 stars,/Nuwave-Bravo-Fryer-Toaster-Oven/dp/B0BQ13RJ6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Nuwave Bravo Air Fryer Toaster Oven Combo, 12-in-1 Smart Convection Ovens Countertop 30QT with Integrated Digital Temperature Probe, Tray, Basket, Fry Rack and Recipes"

" July 18, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,PJvb,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an interesting toaster over/air fryer combo. To start with, it does take up quite a bit of space. Make sure to check dimensions against your space to ensure it will fit and take into account that the top and sides do get hot so it probably shouldn't be tightly against the bottoms of upper cabinets or other items. It comes with a rack, bake tray, rotisserie contraption, and a crumb catcher for the bottom. Mine came with what seems to be a bit of the silver paint on the handle chipped off but other than that, it looks nice.. The instructions are a bit difficult to understand and I've mostly relied on trial and error. There are several modes, top heat, bottom heat, top & bottom heat, toast, pizza, dough proofing, and a few others. For several of the modes, including toast, you have to set two separate temperature settings which I find a bit odd. The instructions say something about making sure they aren't more than 70 degrees (or something like that) different. I'm not sure why you would pick different temperatures for cooking in such a relatively small space unless it was perhaps to avoid something browning too much on the top or bottom while you were cooking. I've not experimented too much with this, just keeping the temperature the same for both.. There are a few little quirks, for example when using the toast function the timer won't count down. you can set it and it will blink when it's toasting but the number won't change. When it is done, it will beep. The actual beep is pretty quiet though, so if you won't be standing right next to it, I would suggest setting a separate timer. It's possible the timer for the toast function is more a ""toasted"" amount than a time but I haven't had any issue assuming it was a timer and using as such.. I have had some chemical smell when in use, mostly after it is done cooking and in the cool down period (but that may be more that it takes that long to get to the temperature that makes the smell). It doesn't linger for too long and is only noticeable right next to the oven. Hopefully this fades with time and use.. All in all, I am enjoying having this as an option for cooking. I look forward to experimenting with it more in the future to realize just how much it can do.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/spoonlemon-Convection-Countertop-Stainless-Accessories/dp/B0BYZ1L2MN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"spoonlemon Air Fryer Toaster Oven Combo, 9-in-1 38QT Convection Countertop Oven, Smart Stainless Steel Oven Air Fryer with 75 Recipes & Accessories for 6-Slice Toast 12'' Pizza for Family Feasts"

" July 13, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Shayne,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So when I first saw this, I was very excited because I had an old 9 in 1 air fryer that died on me. So I was really excited to get this one. I have to say, I really love it. I love all the functions and the features. It's very digital. A lot of control options. I Quiet it is. It is a little bit on the bigger side, but it still fits on my counter. I can fit more food in there. One of the biggest features that I absolutely love about this is that I can bake my cakes in here beautifully. I bake a lot of cakes, and sometimes I don't have enough space in my oven. So being able to use this in conjunction with my regular oven has. helped me tremendously. The only. negative that I can say about this is it's not technically an air fryer. It doesn't really have that function. The fan is good and quiet, but not powerful enough to put it in that category of air fryer. Nor does it have even the air fryer option. So I think they should take that off and not advertise it as the air fryer, but overall this is a very good oven. It bakes evenly, heats and bakes well etc. One other small thing I will say is I feel like you have to turn the heat up a little bit higher. For example, when I'm baking a cake at 350 it takes longer than a regular oven so I turn the heat up by 5 degrees and it works better so bump up your temp a bit especially when trying to ""air fry"" something.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/spoonlemon-Convection-Countertop-Stainless-Accessories/dp/B0BYZ1L2MN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"spoonlemon Air Fryer Toaster Oven Combo, 9-in-1 38QT Convection Countertop Oven, Smart Stainless Steel Oven Air Fryer with 75 Recipes & Accessories for 6-Slice Toast 12'' Pizza for Family Feasts"
