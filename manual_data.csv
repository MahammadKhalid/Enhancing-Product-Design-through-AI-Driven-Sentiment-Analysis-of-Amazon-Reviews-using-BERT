"A good idea, but, in the end not worth it.

1st - the discs are a good size, but, have no absorbency. I use micelar water for cleansing and it just beads and runs over the edge before it has a chance to sink in to the pad. This actually makes me doubt the “organic” claim somewhat. I have no proof one way or the other. I only have my experience with other organic cotton products to guide me here.

2nd - Washing up. The mesh bag is much too small to allow the discs to get properly clean in the washing machine, so I used a larger mesh bag I have for other things. Make up stains didn’t come out making me feel as if I am not using a clean product. Also, the wash cycle leaves the pads shrunk and crumpled up like a fortune cookie. They will never have the same aesthetically pleasing form they arrived in, unless you wish to iron them out after you wash them. That may be a lot of trouble for something you use to clean your face with, but your decision.

3rd - On arrival the presentation is pretty enough, but, the cardboard storage box is not something that will hold up in the steamy bathroom environment. In a paper vs. humidity battle, humidity will always win. I don’t care how good your bathroom fan is, that room is going to get humid and the storage box is going to get ruined quickly.",Performance

Good so far. Easy to clean and use. I love that there was a variety of sizes and lots of them in the pack unlike the original beeswrap where you only get two to three in a set.

"Had some problems with this design. Perhaps more an issue with the design of the coffee maker itself? Meaning, if the coffee machines coffee cup holder size is too small, you will then have an reusable coffee cut as this product, also made too small. I like a strong cup of coffee, that does NOT mean, ""use less water"" to concentrate the amount of coffee by the amount of water being used; indicative of espresso. No. That means I want to use MORE coffee per cup. Fundamental built-in flaw into the design of the model B60 Im using. Of course, the coffee maker coffee cup size dictates the size of the reusable cup as we see here. That said, the design of this cup FURTHER added to my frustration in that the design where the water is injected at the top of the cup, the lid, routes the water jet mostly to the sides, and not even enough at that. It neglects the top of the coffee cup where I can find almost dry coffee grinds. At first I tried just having to LIMIT EVEN MORE my already too limited amount of coffee so that the top of the total amount of coffee in the cup was lower...not happy. What I ended up trying was literally cut every other small piece of plastic that makes up the inbound jet on the lid; i cut them at the top and folded that little piece of plastic out...which I hoped would help jet more water upwards towards the top of the coffee line. That worked better. I would suggest this mod... Other than the fundamental cup size by Keurig, this product worked as desired, with the modification I made. I hope all that made sense....",Ergonomics

Pros:
1. You can use any type of ground coffee you want.
2. You'll save money over buying coffee out daily.

4. Minimal wait time over cold brew packs and no need to have space in the fridge for a pitcher.

Cons:
1. Despite using the same type and amount of coffee and same amount of water, after 30 days of use my coffee tastes watered down almost immediately now.
2. There is no drip tray. Even switching the lever to off, it still drips onto your counters.
3. The basket that the filter goes into isn't very secure and doesn't ""lock"" into the machine.
4. Total time; filling with water, filling the tumbler with ice, adding ground coffee to the basket, letting it brew and then adding your creamer and/or sugar is about 8 minutes. (Coming from cold brew packs this feels like an eternity.)

"I like the idea of minimal waste floss, but there are some catches. The floss is really hard on the gums- you have to floss just so, so as not to cause irritation. The floss breaks/rips often in between teeth. I had to use multiple alternative flossers just to get the broken charcoal floss out of in between my teeth. Also, after the floss is cut per use, it often gets stuck under the cutting mechanism- if you don’t have nails, or your nails are too long, you might have to resort to using tweezers to get the tiniest length out from under the cutting mechanism.
These are slight inconveniences to suffer, but I suppose in the long run it’s worth it.",Ease of Use

The seal is not great, so if it has air in it and the slightest pressure hits it, it will pop open.

Very easy to dismantle and recycle.

I only caution to really clean the area well before using a bandage. I use 98% isopropyl rubbing alcohol at least around the wound, let it dry for a minute, then place the bandage. Otherwise your skin oil will prevent them from sticking. Especially if you are going to sleep with a bandage overnight. You really have to press it down too, its not just slap it on fast and go on your day.

"I love this floss and the container. I started flossing daily using plastic flossers and realized I didn’t want to be using that much plastic. I found this alternative and it is great!

My responses to reviews I read that made me doubt making the purchase:
1) The edges of the bamboo container were smooth and matched up perfectly. It fits together nice and snug.
2) The floss is grippier than most synthetic floss, but my dentist told me this is ideal and helps remove more tartar and bacteria than smooth floss.
3) The floss doesn’t break any more than synthetic floss. I have one tooth that is notorious for busting any floss I use. With flossing every day for the last 100 days I have experienced this floss break about 4-6 times.
4) This container seems like it will never run out. 100 days in and I still haven’t even needed to use my refill spool that came with it.
5) Economical - given the last point, this floss will last me at least 6 months with the initial spool and the refill. Completely worth it.

You literally either have to a) lay on your stomach at a water source and sip your brains out through the straw or b) fill up a cup and sip through that.

"I purchased this after searching on Amazon for ""spice infuser"" which I intend to use in pickling this summer. The measurements posted on the site are accurate and I should have used a ruler to see what I was going to get because the actual product was smaller than I imagined. (See my photo of one infuser next to a standard teaspoon.) I'm glad that I bought the two-pack; I expect that I will have to use both infusers to get an adequate seasoning of my pickle brine. These infusers appear to be fine for making a cup of tea or two, but no more. After making a single cup using a scant teaspoon of leaves, the basket was absolutely packed with wet tea leaves. The mesh on the side walls is extremely fine, so tea leaves should not get lodged in them to clog the pores. The holes at the top are a bit larger than those on the side walls, but small enough that tea leaves will not leak into your brew. They are so small, however, that it may require repeated dunking in the cup to allow all the air to escape from around the tea leaves so that the leaves are fully immersed and steeping. The hanging chain and hook appear to be sturdy and the lid is sturdier than the basket itself. I appreciate that the screw-on-cap secures to the cylinder to create a firmer seal than my old tea infusers. The drainage saucer is simply a piece of stamped metal and very shallow. I expect that the only thing that will keep tea from spilling over onto the counter as the infuser drains into it is the surface tension of the liquid. My saucers did not have edges sharp enough to cut me, but a slight variation in the manufacturing process could cause the cutting hazard that another reviewer described. I hope that the edge of the cylinder seal is more sturdy than it looks. It appears to be stamped or soldered in six places to seal it. I fear that the edges may separate after a moderate period of use. When the overall quality of this product is considered, I could imagine that if they were sold individually at the Dollar Store, the manufacturer would still make a decent profit.",Safety

 I really wanted to like this. I like the idea behind the company and I am trying to avoid single-use plastics. However, this just didn't pan out. I was concerned with the longevity of the spray bottles considering that they're reusable. However, when it breaks on the first use, then I'm not really cutting down on my single-use plastics. And the other bottle just keeps leaking, though I'm not sure from where. Every time I pick it up, there's a puddle underneath.

Sorry for the wobbly video, I was trying to show that I toggled the spray bottle off and then on again.

PROs:
+ Quick delivery
+ Straight forward instructions
+ Only need water
+ Biodegradable packaging
+ Foaming handsoap bottle is durable and made of glass

CONs:
- Spray bottle for the Multipurpose cleaner broke on the first spray
- Spray bottles are both made of plastic
- Leaking bottle

Handsoap bottle is glass
Both spray bottles are plastic
Spray mechanism broke on first use
One bottle leaks continuously",Durability

Installation is too complicated because the steps given in the manual is unclear.

No holes available to fix the control box. Needed to drill a pair of hole by myself to fix the control box.

The pipe they have given to cover the metal rod connected to motor is very cheap and if you apply even a little extra pressure it will break

They have given a small screws to hold the pipe covering the motor which is a crap and the screw head will break easily when you tighten with the screw driver

The small size L screw driver which came along bent easily and I was required to find one from my toolset and use that. Because what they sent are of cheap quality

The control button panel is a thin cheap plastic

"Pro's:
- Very lightweight and packs small
- Uses the sun to charge it
- Loops for hanging on various items

Con's:
- Not very durable
- Not very bright

So, if you are looking for something super lightweight that packs down to a small size, this is perfect. It only weights 5.44 ounces, and it packs to about the size of a small cup saucer. You will hardly notice it in your pack when carrying it. Another nice feature of this is that it is solar powered, so you don't have to worry about running out of battery power. Just loop it to the back of your pack with the light's loops, and you can charge it as you hike. These are great features in this little light.

However, this light has some serious downsides in my eyes. The material that it is made out of just feels really soft and flimsy. I just don't see it really holding up well walking in the woods. It seems to me that it would be really easy to poke this with a thorn accidentally and just ruin the whole thing. Also, it really is not that bright. Even on the brightest setting, it did not put out much light. You would not be able to use it for much other than to light the small immediately surrounding area. For that reason, I don't see much need to even carry this light on a hike. I'd say go with something else.

"These work well enough, and I believe in the ""smaller footprint"" in concept - I just wish these things were not so hard to chew. The flavor is fine and breath-freshening, I'm sure. The foaming process takes too long and certainly does not overwhelm. I chew vigorously, transferring the tablet from one side to the other for more even distribution, but little granules of it never do get chewed - or foamy - so, by the time I have finished brushing, there are still little hard bits of unchewed tablet to be spat out. I think they should be smaller and softer and produce more foam while leaving no extraneous debris behind. I will finish the box, of course - but will not order more of this brand.",Safety

"This product is the Green Works Compostable Wipes repackaged and renamed. I have been buying these for years. My Amazon history shows my first purchase in 2015, but that was after I could no longer find them in the stores. Originally Green Works was Clorox Green Works and I could buy them locally. But once Clorox dropped the brand, I could only buy them online. Even had a automatic shipment set up. Lucky me as I happened to receive a package of six in December 2019 which managed to last through 2020 into 2021. But when I tried buying them again, they were no where to be found. I saw these from Clorox and wondered if they could be at least similar. Not only are they similar, they are the exact same product with a new name and packaging.

What I love about these wipes is the feel. They don't have that slimy wax paper feel that regular wipes have. These feel more like a paper towel. I've used them for so long because we have cats and I am constantly cleaning up after them. I wanted something without harmful chemicals that I could use around their food, toys, beds and litter boxes and have been pleased with these, in all incarnations, for around eight years.",Safety

"Wow, these really suck. I have seen these sheets and wanted to try them. I like to try & be environmentally conscious. Since I am moving across the country, I figured this would be a great time to try some. My only real problem with them is that you have to use 4 sheets to wash a load. I normally use Tide, just fill up the tray on my machine. About a cap full per load and everything is fine. My kids get very dirty. I think their favorite thing to do is dig in dirt. I tried using a sheet, didn't even look like my clothes had been washed. I kept upping it. It takes 4 sheets to do a load I normally used 1 cap full on. They smell fine, I bought 4 boxes, 2 different scents. They don't really leave a smell on the clothes. They are really convenient. I just rip one up & throw it in the laundry basket with the dirty clothes everytime I've gotten about a sheet full ( about a lightly filled small laundry basket worth) then just dump the whole thing in the washer.

"Had some problems with this design. Perhaps more an issue with the design of the coffee maker itself? Meaning, if the coffee machines coffee cup holder size is too small, you will then have an reusable coffee cut as this product, also made too small. I like a strong cup of coffee, that does NOT mean, ""use less water"" to concentrate the amount of coffee by the amount of water being used; indicative of espresso. No. That means I want to use MORE coffee per cup. Fundamental built-in flaw into the design of the model B60 Im using. Of course, the coffee maker coffee cup size dictates the size of the reusable cup as we see here. That said, the design of this cup FURTHER added to my frustration in that the design where the water is injected at the top of the cup, the lid, routes the water jet mostly to the sides, and not even enough at that. It neglects the top of the coffee cup where I can find almost dry coffee grinds. At first I tried just having to LIMIT EVEN MORE my already too limited amount of coffee so that the top of the total amount of coffee in the cup was lower...not happy. What I ended up trying was literally cut every other small piece of plastic that makes up the inbound jet on the lid; i cut them at the top and folded that little piece of plastic out...which I hoped would help jet more water upwards towards the top of the coffee line. That worked better. I would suggest this mod... Other than the fundamental cup size by Keurig, this product worked as desired, with the modification I made.",Ergonomics
