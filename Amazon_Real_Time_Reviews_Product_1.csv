" October 3, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,Lifeon2wheels,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update! After 90 days of life with this machine, I absolutely love it. I've already saved half the cost of the new machine by not buying Nespresso capsules and the coffee is excellent. Highly recommended. Read on for my entire review and please click the ""helpful"" button if it helps you.. 30 days of Life with a Tchibo Automatic Espresso Coffee Machine. Pros:. • Nice looking.. • Very easy to use.. • Feels and seems very well made.. • Creates excellent coffee smells when brewing.. • Has a cool light that illuminates your coffee cup while brewing.. • Makes a very flavorful espresso or cup of coffee with a nice amount of crema on top.. • The coffee is hot, hot enough for me anyway. I don’t need or like very hot coffee, and often let mine sit to cool or, if I’m in a hurry, even drop an ice cube in it to cool it off (sacrilege for many, I know). When placed in a travel mug, the coffee remains very hot for several hours.. • Bean hopper holds a large amount of beans, especially with the extension piece.. • Bean hopper is nicely sealed to keep beans fresh.. • Controls are nicely illuminated, are clear to use, and consist of a lit area to push like a touch screen phone computer screen. This makes the buttons super easy to “push.”. • Tray that holds spent grinds and excess water is easy to remove, clean, and reinstall.. • Brew unit is easily accessible from the side and easy to remove, clean, and reinstall.. • Water container is easy to remove, refill, and reinstall.. • The height adjustable brew nozzle is a nice feature that moves in its up and down travel with a feeling of high quality.. Cons:. • As many have said, water container is a bit on the small side and needs to be filled often if you are making coffee. Espresso drinkers won’t have as much of an issue, but I end up filling my water container after every use when making coffee.. • Machine is too tall to remove and refill the water container if there are cabinets above the machine. Machine must be moved forward of cabinets to remove water container, refill, and reinstall. I placed the machine on a large trivet with sliding felt pads mounted underneath it which makes things much easier to move around and I highly recommend that approach.. • The machine is a bit heavy (not a bad thing as it indicates it is well made in my book), but it makes it more difficult to slide it in and out from below cabinets.. • If water runs out during brewing or when warming up at first start, and water is re-filled, one must be ready for the machine to continue immediately…this is challenging since when I slide the machine forward to refill the machine, it is on the edge of my counter and there is not room to place a cup. A way around this is to slide the machine sideways while refilling (which is easier for me on the felt bottomed trivet I describe just above). While the instructions specifically say not to do this, another way around this problem is to refill the water container by pouring (just enough) water to finish the brewing process directly into the container without taking it out – again, not easy unless one moves the unit forward of the cabinets above.. • Crema could be a bit thicker and a little more flavorful (again, compared to the Nespresso Intenso), but this could also be a function of the beans chosen.. • Grind setting can only be adjusted when the grinder is running. This isn’t a terrible problem for me since I have set it on the finest setting and haven’t changed it since because I like a strong brew. However, if different people are using the machine in the same household and each prefers a different strength brew, it is something to keep in mind.. • Oily or flavored beans with a coating cannot be used or it will damage the grinder. I prefer non-flavored beans so this isn’t a big deal for me. I’ve also not had a problem finding “dryer” beans (the Tchibo coffees work well, and Peet’s “Major Dickason’s” is also purported to work well though I haven’t tried it yet).. • It’s not quiet. I don’t find this to be a problem, and I kind of like the sounds it makes. It crunches the beans and makes a whirring sound which is probably the brew unit moving along its track. Just keep in mind that if your significant other is sleeping, that person will likely be awakened.. Things to keep in mind:. • As I mentioned above, the buttons are super light and easy to touch. This is a nice feature, but they are easy to hit inadvertently when load the bean hopper or even if one brushes the “buttons” by accident. I have adopted the approach of turning off the machine when re-loading the hopper.. • I plan on running a descaling cycle monthly using an espresso machine specific de-scaler (as opposed to vinegar). I only say this because I think with any higher pressure machine, de-scaling is important to maintain the machine. I have run the de-scaling cycle once during this review time and it is simple to follow the directions in the manual.. My background – I’ve tried many ways to brew coffee including: drip, Nespresso, Keurig, percolated, a “true” espresso machine, stove-top espresso machine, pour-over, cold-brew, and French press. I prefer a very strong coffee, but do not like bitterness.. I used my Nespresso for more “special” occasions (mostly weekends) and liked the coffee it makes. My favorite flavor capsule was Intenso, and I also liked the Stormio and Odacio flavors but not as much. I never liked the capsule approach as think it’s wasteful and has too much of an impact on the environment. While I applaud that Nespresso minimizes the impact of the capsule approach by providing free recycling bags which saves the aluminum and composts the coffee, I think that process creates a large carbon footprint. The final straw for me though was the machines don’t last. My first one died within a year. Nespresso was great in replacing it for me. The second one died after about two years, and Nespresso repaired it for me free of charge. I don’t use the machine enough to have it die so soon – at the most 100 cycles per year. Nespresso has great customer service, but when I saw the Tchibo, I found it very appealing because it doesn’t use capsules.. My opinion on the other methods is as follows. It’s not even worth talking much about Keurig in my humble opinion. The plastic waste is inexcusable and the coffee it makes is simply not good – it’s better than instant, which isn’t saying much. I love pour-over coffee, but it’s a fair amount of work and I just don’t want to spend the time in the morning, especially during the week when running off to work. French press is a bit too much work too, and I don’t have a grinder which is needed to be able to make a course grind to effectively use a French press. Percolated coffee is too much effort too. Ditto for a true espresso machine and stove-top espresso machine. Drip coffee is a nice staple, but it’s not “special” in that it doesn’t create crema and it can be bitter depending on the beans used. I love my cold brewer for the summer (a simple filter inside of a mason jar), but when it gets cold outside, I want a hot coffee.. Beans used: Tchibo Classic Blend – using these beans, the coffee is flavorful and pleasant, but even in the finest settings with the boost function, I long for a bit more punch. My old Nespresso machine when using Intenso made a stronger cup, but it was also more bitter, so there is a trade-off. I would liken the Classic Blend in the Tchibo to the Stormio or Odacio Nespresso Capsules. I’ve also tried the Tchibo Röstmeister beans which are a dark roast and they yield a lot stronger flavor which is more akin to my preferred Intenso Nespresso brew. I also plan on trying Peet’s Major Dickason’s blend as they have confirmed for me that these are non-oily (see above, oily or flavored beans are not recommended for this machine as they gum up the grinder).. I used the machine a lot (at least once a day, sometimes more) during these first 30 days and am quite happy. The pros of the machine definitely outweigh the cons. I remain hopeful that the machine will remain reliable, and I will update this review once more time passes.. In conclusion, I do highly recommend this machine and I hope this review has been helpful! If so, please hit the thumbs up!",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Tchibo-Single-Serve-Coffee-Built/dp/B0BZTJQQTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Tchibo Single Serve Coffee Maker - Automatic Espresso Coffee Machine - Built-in Grinder, No Coffee Pods Needed - Comes with x2 17.6 Ounce Bags of Whole Beans"
" November 13, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,knotpc,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We purchased this coffee maker in January of 2021. It makes a perfect cup of coffee every time. From a product standpoint, refilling with water is a pain if the unit is placed on a counter with a cabinet above it, as you must pull the coffee maker out to remove the water carrier to refill it, which needs to be refilled about every four - five cups off coffee.. Last week we descaled the unit, following the instructions. Now the unit is stuck in its rinse cycle, having gone through gallons of water. Power cycling and even letting the unit set unplugged for 48 hours has not resolved the issue. Customer support from the company is virtually non-existent via chat ( never works ). Calls to customer support are problematic with either the line ringing busy or constant disconnection. We have been waiting three business days as of today for a call back from technical support. So buyer beware if you ever need support.",5.0 out of 5 stars,/Tchibo-Single-Serve-Coffee-Built/dp/B0BZTJQQTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Tchibo Single Serve Coffee Maker - Automatic Espresso Coffee Machine - Built-in Grinder, No Coffee Pods Needed - Comes with x2 17.6 Ounce Bags of Whole Beans"

" October 7, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Zach S. ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"We love the convenience of this machine.. Overall it makes a decent espresso, not amazing but it’s just about as good as a entry level manual espresso machine we had before. You can’t adjust many variables obviously, other than the grind level. It needs to grind a bit finer for espresso.. The coffee boost button helps a bit for making the espresso more full bodied.. It does need the water refilled every other day basically but that’s not a huge deal.. Overall, we are still happy with the purchase. We knew going in looking at reviews that it wasn’t going to be the top tier espresso quality, but we love the convenience factor of it. We will experiment some more with different beans and see if that helps as well. We so far only used the free bags it came with.. The noise isn’t too bad, not much worse than our old espresso maker..

Ability to brew from espresso to super extra large as well as adjusting grinder to make flow faster or slower (fine grind=slow brew but improved taste) is wonderful. You can't beat the taste!

" September 8, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The machine is amazing, great espresso, easy to clean, absolutely worth the money! Highly recommend!. BUT, just be aware the customer service is abysmal. The unit arrived and after setting everything up and pressing the power button the unit would not turn on. The only backlight icon was an orange triangle warning light. We called the customer service line and the tech quickly entered a case on our behalf, but said a separate department would need to call us back to troubleshoot.. I couldn’t wait that long and really wanted coffee so after lots of troubleshooting it turns out a small piece of plastic was broken off the side door cover. So the unit essentially thought the side cover was open. I could not find the piece in the box so I assume it happened prior to packaging. With some rigged plastic stuck into the slot and some tape over the cover I tricked the machine into thinking everything was good to go, and was able to make my coffee!. Days later no call back from customer service. Called again and they said they would have someone check on our case and send a new piece. No call ever came. Repeated 2 more times and still nothing. So I still have blue painters tape over the side of my machine…but if you’re lucky to get a working unit the espresso is wonderful!",4.0 out of 5 stars,/Tchibo-Single-Serve-Coffee-Built/dp/B0BZTJQQTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Tchibo Single Serve Coffee Maker - Automatic Espresso Coffee Machine - Built-in Grinder, No Coffee Pods Needed - Comes with x2 17.6 Ounce Bags of Whole Beans"
" July 31, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,K2Dadio,4.0 out of 5 stars,"PROS. - Convenient fully automatic brewing machine, saves time making coffee in the morning.. - Easy to operate. - Sleek, high-tech and modern design, looks very nice on the kitchen counter. - Perfect height to fit under upper cabinets. - Makes a good cuppa... both a regular cup and espresso-sized. - Three fill/size options. - Impressive mechanical noises during a brew and pour cycle. CONS. - Front touch controls randomly unresponsive and require quick power-off/on to fix. - Coffee bean hopper not steep enough resulting in random false ""out of coffee"" faults. - Adjustable front pour spout does not go high enough for travel mug or larger cup (seems a missed good-design opportunity). - It is a bit loud doing its mechanical cycle (wakes up the sleeping house). - Water reservoir is in back and a bit awkward to remove and fill. Had to get a separate container with a long pour spout to fill... and since the reservoir is smallish, need to fill it frequently.. - No water temp adjustment.. Overall I am happy with the purchase. I am worried a bit about longevity with all the mechanical internals. Only time will tell. Our old drip coffee maker was still in great working shape after seven years (we gave it to our son), but the we wanted to shave some time off the coffee-making process. Also, used to have a Nespresso pod machine for espresso... but have too many machines on the kitchen counter. This unit takes care of all of our coffee beverage needs and saves valuable counter real estate.. The only final ""con"" is that the larger cup choices just push more water through the espresso-sized grind... resulting in a weaker brew than I prefer. With a good drip machine you can increase the amount of ground coffee in the filter to get a stronger brew. So, what I tend to do is select the medium-size option and then do an espresso shot after the first pour is done. The result is just right for my needs.",4.0 out of 5 stars,/Tchibo-Single-Serve-Coffee-Built/dp/B0BZTJQQTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Tchibo Single Serve Coffee Maker - Automatic Espresso Coffee Machine - Built-in Grinder, No Coffee Pods Needed - Comes with x2 17.6 Ounce Bags of Whole Beans"
" October 8, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,DM,3.0 out of 5 stars,"$400 coffee machine- it BETTER make great tasting coffee. At least they give you two bags of their whole bean with purchase, to make you understand that you can't just put any coffee bean in this and magically get great tasting coffee. Nope... use high quality beans! It matters.. As my title states, there's a few flaws. After months of use, every morning, Mon thru Sun, average 2 cups a day, I've ran into 2 major flaws and a 3rd so-so flaw.. 1st, and probably the biggest flaw, is the grinder. The grinder would not allow the beans to fall down the slot during grind. I'd get a watered down cup of coffee and waste some beans. I'd have to slide it out from under my cabinet to access the bean grinder chute, stir it around to get the beans to fall down the grinder chute.. 2nd flaw is when the water reservoir is below the minimum water level, it stops the process, NO MATTER WHAT. Even though it usually has enough water to finish. Fine. But here's the flaw- when you go to refill the reservoir and drop back in the machine, it INSTANTLY continues the brewing. In my case, I have to move the drip pan and cup out of the way to slide the whole machine out from under the cabinets to access the water reservoir and coffee bean chute. This has caused a few messes on my floor and foot burn. I HAVE TO REMEMBER to hold my mug under the spout while dropping the water reservoir back in. Then carefully and skillfully slide the whole machine AND mug back under the cabinet, place the drip tray under my mug that's in the other hand. My whole kitchen is designed with cabinetry and no open countertop. So I'm stuck with doing some juggling when things like this happen.. 3rd, the machine will not brew if it detects that the used coffee ground tray needs emptying. That's fine, except about 3 times already that it falsely warned me. I would open to empty but there's only 1 or 2 cups worth of old grounds in the tray. Usually can hold up to 6-8 cups worth. Strange.. Conclusion: in my situation and kitchen layout, it sucks for me. But yhe design flaw with the grinder and water refill features has everything to do with their design and engineering. But, it does check all the boxes for what's important: great tasting coffee, from fresh grounded beans, 1 cup at a time. No more wasted coffee instead and burnt coffee!",3.0 out of 5 stars,/Tchibo-Single-Serve-Coffee-Built/dp/B0BZTJQQTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Tchibo Single Serve Coffee Maker - Automatic Espresso Coffee Machine - Built-in Grinder, No Coffee Pods Needed - Comes with x2 17.6 Ounce Bags of Whole Beans"

It is my first espresso machine and I am so far satisfied with the espresso quality and the milk frother. However the grinder seemed a bit inconsistent from the beginning and unfortunately it broke completely a couple of weeks back.. Somehow the beans are getting stuck and when I called customer care they asked me to vacuum the grinder, which didn't help. It is nearly impossible and possibly warranty voiding if I want to clean the grinder myself as it involves taking apart the machine. Also something to note - their customer care is very hard to get hold of. It has been over two weeks since I raised complain but no response from them about the recourse.

" November 10, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,michael moster,5.0 out of 5 stars,I normally don't write reviews but this needed to be shared. We bought the machine about a month ago... it's awesome and we use it a lot. One great feature that I did not expect is how fast it heats up. Recently noticed coffee dripping from the side of the metal gadget that holds the coffee. It was not a big issue as it still landed in the cup but we thought we should contact the vendor as it's still under warranty.. I had to send an email and expected to have to wait a few days for a reply. They got back to me within 2 hours ... apologized profusely for the inconvenience and offered to send out a new machine as a replacement..

" June 17, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,amber fortin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a bit of a latte addict., I was spending a lot of money at dunkin. One of m friends had a breville machine, she showed my how easy it was to make a latte at home. When I started researching machines breville was even more pricey than this machine. I took a chance and went with this one because its $300 cheaper. I do think the breville machine is nicer overall but for the price, this machine works great once you figure out the bugs. The directions suck, and the video sorta helps but they miss a few steps. On the machine is says to preheat to warm the machine up, the video never mentions that. So that had me stumped for a little bit because the frother has a preheat mode. I kept preheating the frother, which then backed it self up and was blowing steam out the bottom. So beware of that. No idea why that happened, i don't use the frother because I don't want to blow the machine up.. I prob did 25 or so test runs the first day i got it,trying to figure out how fine to grind the beans to get the machine in the espresso range. I personally just stick with 8. I played with it a bunch, 8 is what they recommend it seams to work the best. The tamping was another curve ball. You don't need to overtamp, if you do It'll peg the machine way past the espresso pressure. So I do 8 on the grind and a very light tamp and I'm typically on the high end of the espresso pressure bar.. Also, they sell the syrups at Marshalls. I paid $7 for the big bottle of the caramel syrup compared to $7 for the mini bottle at target.. All in all, I literally love having this machine in my house.

" April 14, 2023",Reviewed in the United States ,Roger,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this espresso machine back in December and absolutely loved the machine. Money saved from buying Starbucks was well spent so I thought in the beginning. My wife and I used this machine daily and we perform weekly maintenance upkeep of the grinder and other preventive maintenance. We were able to narrow down the settings and use the best beans for the grinder to make the perfect brew. This morning while making an espresso, there was a loud metal to metal sound with the grinder. Initially I thought a bean was stuck in the grind however it turned to be much worse. The malfunction does not allow the grinder to be removed to clear any obstructions. After about an hour of trying to remove the grinder I attempted to contact Casabrews and their customer service number is out of service which gave me pause and made my buyers remorse kick into overdrive. I sent an email to the company and did not hear anything from them until later into the evening. Contacted Amazon and shared my situation with them. Amazon is going to accept the return and I am absolutely appreciative.. Casabrews was able to reached by email at support@casabrews.com and responded to my concerns about the machine. They were very professional and courteous in their response and I did not have to return the product to Amazon for refund. Casabrews stood by their product and made sure the process was seamless in sending a new machine. I have always purchased quality products like Kitchen Aid, Breville and others who have remarkable track record with the quality of their product and customer service. Casabrews I will gladly rank your product with those I just mention. I am absolutely happy with the end result of a bad situation and hopefully other customers see the value of your machine as we have.

" August 23, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Woodrat59,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my first espresso machine at a Starbucks in 1995 and have been making mostly cappuccino forever. I was a little reluctant to buy a machine I had never heard of, had only a few reviews from beginners and enthusiasts, and, going forward...who knows? But. Three cappuccinos in, I have just made the best one in 27 years! First impression of this machine - very impressed. I may or may not write more going forward, but I'll say a couple more things in Casabrews favor. My first day I received an email from them checking in and asking how it was going...and they sent several pdf's to help. They provide a complete second grinder mechanism in case you need to fix, adjust, clean or otherwise need a clean start. And, as of the writing of this, I got an instant $150 coupon taking the price of the machine to $500. So. Initially. Recommended! Good luck, happy brewing. Enjoy.... Update:. I had reason to email Casabrews with a question as I am trying to figure out the grind and pressure. The next day my phone rings and it's a call from mainland China. And ""Martin"" (I'm sure actual Chinese name was different), introduces himself with his chief engineer. He is ""the boss."" And when they explain they are not sure about my problem, they offer to send me a back up grinder, (the unit already comes with one), and to pay for me to send mine to an address in California, (at their expense), so they can research the issue. Amazing! Who does this in this day and age? Let alone across the world, caring to understand about a customer problem. And we all think China, and companies there are other-worldly. How fantastic for them to care and make the effort across the language barrier and pay the freight. Bravo, Casabrews! Still learning the machine, but even a bigger fan now!. Update 2:. One year on. Still love its performance. Fairly flawless.

What better way to start your day? And then there's Affogato for dessert.... Update: Don’t for forget to check/turn on the eco switch (underneath machine on right). Not doing so may cause the machine to over heat. I made this mistake and had to reset the thermostats which meant removing the top panels to access. Easy to do but, it just takes a few minutes.. I have subsequently pressure tested my machine and found it at 13 bars - too high. Brought it down to 9 bars. Installed a flow control which gives an extraordinary degree of control when pulling a shot.. Last but not least, after testing and adjusting the pressure to 9 bars (which will pretty much remain static), I installed a thermostat as, if left idling too long, the water in the group head can reach almost boiling. The thermostat allows you to purge some of the water until it comes down to about 191-193.. I also installed a digital timer device which switches the machine on 30 or 40 minutes before I wake to ensure the machine is ready for me when I get downstairs and shuts off at about mid morning. I can override the device at any time (ie: after dinner, cleaning) by using an app on my phone.. Maintenance is very important to any espresso machine, weekly inspections, bi-weekly group head cleaning/back washing, bi-monthly water tank cleaning (This is where I throw in a new filter pod, also very important - Seattle Coffee has them). It has been several months and I can tell you that these are must have mods and they're relatively inexpensive and very easy to install.. Additionally, you’ll want to order the really super nice and sturdy SS cup bar Seattle Coffee) to replace the flimsy plastic one that it comes with..

I tried a couple of sub $1k machines, but continually faced the same disappointment. Not enough power to make an espresso after frothing milk. I’d have to wait up to 5 mini before the machine would rebuild pressure. Not that great when you’re trying to make more than a couple of coffees for a dinner party. Granted the Rocket does not immediately have enough pressure if you take too long to froth your milk, but it takes a minute to rebuild the pressure. It takes about 15 minutes after turning the machine on before it is ready, but honestly, it’s not a big deal. Coffee always tastes great and I’ll never go buy coffee from a coffee shop again, unless I’m out of town (of course).. It’s easy to clean and as long as you don’t use distilled water, you’ll have no problems. Granted it is not an inexpensive machine, but the customer service is timely and responsive.
